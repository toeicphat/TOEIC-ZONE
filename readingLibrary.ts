I did a lot of research, and the Dish Magic 300 seemed to be the best choice. It was pricier than other models, but all of the reviews were excellent. So, I decided to spend the extra money. I have had the dishwasher for one month now, and I could not be happier with my decision. Most importantly, the dishes come out sparkling clean, no matter how dirty they were going in. Also, the machine is so quiet, you do not even know it is running. Lastly, it is designed to use water efficiently, which is very important to me. Overall, I am very pleased with this dishwasher.\nâ Anna Yakovleva`,

"While preparing and eating these meals, you can feel like you are travelling the world with me."\nZahra Chambers, vice president of Kitchen Swifts, says she is pleased to work with Chef Cordero and to offer delicious new recipes to their customers.

It is usually fully booked for dinner; you may need to call months in advance for a table. We had a wonderful lunch there instead. Everything was delicious, and the bread and desserts are baked on-site! It was a worthwhile treat before I flew back to Hong Kong.\n-Meili Guan`,

Managed by Keron Deslandes, the 150-seat restaurant is an aromatic jewel amid the bustling shops and eateries in Wester Square. The servers are always happy to help diners select from the variety of delights on the extensive menu, which includes curried goat, oxtail soup, and red snapper. The restaurant is most famous for its jerk chicken. Marinated for 24 hours prior to grilling and served with sides of stewed cabbage and coconut rice, the dish is a good deal at Â£12.\nIf you stop in on any Friday night between 7 and 11 P.M., you will enjoy live reggae music.\n\n--- REVIEW ---\nhttps://www.dinerreviews.co.uk/orangebaykitchen\nPosted on 22 August by Tamika Peterkin, tpeterkin@sunmail.co.uk\nOrange Bay Kitchen: 2/5 Stars\nAfter reading a glowing article about Orange Bay Kitchen by Rebecca Roats, I was eager to give this place a try. My husband and I arrived there at 7 P.M. yesterday, keen to enjoy live music with our dinner. Unfortunately, the band's performance that night had been cancelled. Undeterred, we stayed and both ordered the jerk chicken. While the chicken's smoky flavour was outstanding, the stewed cabbage was lacking in flavour. Also, the portion size was smaller than we had anticipated, so we ordered another appetiser to avoid going home hungry. The head chef came out to apologise and was extremely nice, but we will probably not go back anytime soon.\n\n--- E-MAIL ---\nTo: tpeterkin@sunmail.co.uk\nFrom: vsmith@orangebaykitchen.co.uk\nDate: 24 August\nSubject: Your review\nAttachment: 0258\nDear Ms. Peterkin,\nThank you for visiting Orange Bay Kitchen and leaving a review. Our manager, Keron Deslandes, told me more about your visit and our failure to live up to your expectations that evening. Please accept the attached Â£20 gift certificate; I do hope that you will give us another try.\nDuring your visit, our band had an equipment malfunction, which is what led to the last-minute cancellation. However, the band will be back performing weekly beginning in September. Also, I want you to know that Head Chef Adio Brown has changed the spices he uses in the stewed cabbage. I am sure you will find them delightful.\nSincerely,\nVea Smith, Owner, Orange Bay Kitchen`,

Dear Mr. Croft,
â [1] â. I have read your inquiry about offering financial management courses at libraries across Queensland. The Society for Financial Management Advisors (SFMA) welcomes the opportunity to partner with the libraries to make basic financial management information more widely available.
You proposed that SFMA members could lead introductory courses at several library branches. â [2] â. SFMA members have offered similar courses to recent graduates, people changing careers, and first-time investors in the past.
â [3] â. If you have a list of library branches that would host the first series of events, I can suggest facilitators who work near those libraries or would be willing to travel to them. Do you have a general profile of the expected attendees? â [4] â. That information would help us tailor the courses to audience needs and interests.
I look forward to meeting with you to develop a plan. Please contact me by telephone at 07 5550 1344 to set up a time to discuss the courses.

Sincerely,
Roberta Otney

Dear Ms. Khoury,
Thank you for forwarding your proposed revisions to the contract for Qualiview Ltd. to be your wholesale supplier of automotive window glass.
First, we will gladly agree to an extension of the contract term from one to three years. Secondly, I am not sure what more we can do to address your concerns about packaging materials. We use custom-built crates and innovative packaging to reduce the risk of breakage during shipping. While we will replace any goods that may be damaged in transit, we do not agree to pay an additional penalty fee in the event of such damage.
I would like to discuss this further with you next week; however, I will be out of the office through Tuesday afternoon. Would you be available to meet before 11:00 A.M. on either Wednesday or Thursday? Friday is also possible. Please let me know a convenient date and time for you.

SINGAPORE (6 June)âRecently, the demand for international freight space has been outpacing the availability of shipping containers. This container shortage has led to higher costs for goods being shipped out of Asian ports. A drop in the production of rolls of steel, the raw material that containers are made from, has further complicated the situation. â [1] â.
Some exporters have considered the more expensive option of air freight, but companies are still faced with a difficult choice. â [2] â. They must either ask their customers to accept shipment delays, or substantially raise customer prices to cover the costs of expedited shipping. Either way, suppliers risk triggering customer dissatisfaction.
"We are working with business partners, investors, and government officials to discuss solutions to this problem," said Henry Lam, a spokesperson for the household goods producer QET Group. â [3] â. "It's going to take total cooperation of all stakeholders to find a solution."
Not all companies are suffering, though. For example, Fezker, the producer of athletic apparel and footwear, has implemented strategies to better overcome this situation. Fezker has successfully refocused its efforts away from exports to western countries and toward expanding its domestic and regional markets. â [4] â.
"We moved quickly, so the shipping container shortage has not caused a significant impact on our profits," said Fezker CEO Nuwa Lee.`,

Subject: Taste-test results
Attachment: Fatior Labs survey results

Hi, Team.
I just received the 24-26 January survey results from Fatior Labs for our new ice-cream taste test. As you can see from the attached document, the results are very disappointing. We sent the four flavours that we considered to be the best, but none of them received high enough ratings to advance to the next stage of development. Most of the reviews were consistent among the 92 taste-test participants in our target market of consumers ages 25 through 40. It's not a big problem if a product gets low scores in colour in the testing phase, since we can easily adjust that in the laboratory. But we should never be sending out samples that are getting scores lower than 3 in the taste category.
I would like to meet at 9 A.M. on Monday (6 February) to figure out how to proceed. There is one flavour we may be able to work with if we make a few adjustments, as suggested by most of our taste testers. We will also need to get some new flavours to Fatior Labs no later than 1 March if we are going to get a new ice cream on the Preston Grocers freezer shelves by the beginning of June.

--- SURVEY FORM ---
Fatior Labs Consumer Taste-Testing Survey
Date: 24 January
Company: Karabel Industries
Participant number: 54
Directions: You will be given a 45 g sample of 4 different ice creams. Please rate the taste, texture, sweetness, and colour of each ice cream on a scale of 1 (very unpleasant) to 5 (very pleasant). Please write any additional comments below.
Flavour | Taste | Texture | Sweetness | Colour
Lemon | 2 | 3 | 2 | 4
Mango | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1
Salted Caramel | 2 | 1 | 1 | 5
Peanut Brittle | 3 | 4 | 2 | 2
Comments: The fruit-flavoured ice creams were surprisingly sour. I did not care for them at all. I think the Peanut Brittle has the most potential, but it's missing something. I bet that adding chocolate swirls or brownie bits would make it a winner.`,

Dear Ms. Benjamin,
I am writing to apply for the copywriter position at Create Great. As an expert fashion designer who also has writing experience, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team. Enclosed please find my rÃ©sumÃ©.

In addition, for the last five years, I have been maintaining my own blog. My posts focus on trends in women's fashion and how to make clothing and cosmetics more sustainable. What started as a hobby has now attracted paying advertisers and over 15,000 followers. Visit www.medesheen.com for examples of my writing.
Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Annie Smith

Subject: Order B19849
Date: August 19

To Whom It May Concern,
Yesterday, I purchased some office supplies on your Web site. I received an e-mail receipt, but the costs are not itemized on it. To satisfy a new company policy, I must give my supervisor a receipt with the charges for each item listed separately. Could you e-mail me such a receipt? If not, is it possible for me to get this information myself from your Web site? Finally, can confirmations for future orders possibly be sent to more than one e-mail address? It would be ideal for my supervisor to automatically receive one.
Thank you,
Akihito Nakashima, Executive Assistant, Gilchrist Shipping

Attachment: B19849

Dear Mr. Nakashima,
Attached is the receipt you requested. In apology for the inconvenience, we will provide you with 10 percent off the total price of your next order. To view a full description of any previous order, first log in to your account on our Web site, go to the "My Orders" tab, and then click on any order number.
I noticed that included in each of your last few orders was an identical order for ten of a particular item. You should know that we will reduce the price for that item by 5 percent if you mark this as a recurring order. To do this, simply check the "Recurring Order" box on the online order form.
As for your final query, this is not possible right now. However, I will share the idea with our technical team.
All the best,
Cameron Higgins, Customer Relations, Fowler Office Supplies

Crawford and Duval Opens Brick-and-Mortar Stores
HONG KONG (18 February)âCrawford and Duval, the online retailer known for its handcrafted blankets, decorative pillows, and other household goods, has established four brick-and-mortar stores in Hong Kong. Last Monday, the company celebrated the grand opening of boutique stores in Causeway Bay, Discovery Bay, and Sheung Wan in addition to a large department store in Central District. While the boutique stores carry the most popular of the small household goods for which Crawford and Duval is famous, the Central District location also boasts an indoor plant department and an on-site cafÃ© that features specialty coffees, teas, and light snacks. Moreover, it has a much more extensive selection of the merchandise than what is available through the company's Web site.

Crawford and Duval comes to our loyal shoppers in Hong Kong!
Crawford and Duval is pleased to announce the opening of its first brick-and-mortar stores in the following locations: Causeway Bay, Discovery Bay, Sheung Wan, and Central District.
Since the launch of our online store five years ago, we have helped you to create the living space of your dreams. Now we make it even easier to decorate your home. Each location has an interior designer on staff, so you can consult with an expert in person while you browse our popular items.
All locations are convenient to public transportation. Our Central District location offers free parking in its attached car park.
As part of our grand-opening celebration, shoppers who visit one of our stores before 1 March will receive a gift card for HK$70 to use during their visit.
Members of our online Frequent Purchase Club will receive the same benefits in our stores, including a 10 percent discount on purchases of HK$500 or more.

What Our Customers Are Saying
Posted by Whitten Tech on October 20
Our team hired Osawa Corporate Team Building to lead an activity for the sales staff at Whitten Tech. The facilitator of the Scavenger Hunt, Lorenzo Benford, was excellent. The 28 members of our sales team all had positive feedback. They reported that they loved exploring the city, learning about its history, and finding new local attractions, even on a cold and cloudy day. I highly recommend this activity. The only downside was that we did not realize how far we would be walking. It would have been helpful to have an idea of the walking distances so we could have been fully prepared.`,

To: All Branch Managers
From: Fran Corliss
Subject: Survey results on mobile banking
Date: April 7

Hello all,
Ogden Bank recently conducted a survey of its customers concerning mobile banking. Here are some key takeaways.
Over 95 percent of our customers own a mobile device. However, although interest in mobile banking is high, only 39 percent of our customers use our application. Some customers cite security concerns (23 percent), but a majority (78 percent) say that they simply do not think the app works well.
A mandatory meeting for all branch managers will be held at our headquarters on April 12 at 4:00 P.M. to brainstorm strategies for responding to this challenge.

Best,
Fran Corliss
Director of Mobile Banking, Ogden Bank

Boost for Mobile Banking
By Edward Panzius

FLEMINGTON (May 25)âOgden Bank has rolled out major improvements to its mobile banking application. It has expanded the variety of tasks that can be accomplished through the app and made it much easier to use.
"Many of our account holders have been frustrated in the past by a clunky, limited app," said Alys DeFreese, manager of the Flemington branch of Ogden Bank. "They can now do just about any task with the app that they could over the phone or by visiting a branch in person. This is just another example of how we support our customers in any way we can."
According to Ms. DeFreese, in the few weeks since the upgrade, 20 percent of account holders have switched to depositing checks and paying bills online. She anticipates that number will rise as more customers learn about the easy-to-use app.
"The convenience made a big difference for me," said account holder Yair Baum. Another customer, Maria Reed, added, âI appreciate the flexibility of being able to do my banking whenever and wherever I want."`,

Dear Ms. Calle,
It was delightful to see you leading the book club yesterday evening. Ms. Beck's Due North is lengthy, and it was a challenge to finish it before the meeting. However, I have to thank you for choosing that book because it revived my childhood interest in traveling to Alaska. In fact, I've already looked up some tours!
The club meeting was packed, and I hardly got to talk to you. We should catch up sometime soon. Perhaps we might try the new French restaurant on Looper Street. I hear it is amazing and reasonably priced.

Sincerely,
Gail Frey`,

To: Undisclosed Recipients
From: iqbal_grewal@woolfflooring.com.au
Date: 12 June
Subject: Cost-savings survey

Dear Colleagues,
At Woolf Flooring we are looking for ways to reduce day-to-day costs without sacrificing product quality, customer service, or staff morale. To this end, we are seeking input from select staff members in a variety of departments via an online survey that can be found at www.surveyquest.com.au/109820. Everyone who has been chosen to take part in the survey has been with the company for at least ten years and, therefore, is very familiar with our processes.
The deadline for completing the survey is 19 June. Note that this survey is for recipients of this e-mail only. Please do not forward this e-mail to others or post the link to the survey elsewhere.
We also plan to hire outside consultants to review our operations and write a report of their findings. We understand that some colleagues disagree with this approach to cutting costs; however, we have determined that getting an outside perspective is a worthwhile investment that will be likely to save us money in the long run.

Best,
Iqbal Grewal, Director of Business Transformation
Woolf Flooring

Woolf Flooring Cost-Savings Survey
Based on your experience as an employee of Woolf Flooring, please provide one idea for a change that could be implemented to improve productivity and cut costs. Thank you.
Date: 18 June
Name and role: Beth Mair, sales manager
I have noticed that some employees grab a new pair of disposable gloves every time they return from a break. They could be using the same ones throughout the whole day. By limiting the use of gloves to one pair per day, Woolf Flooring would save thousands of dollars per year. Doing so would also reduce waste. A new policy regarding the use of personal protective items would be easy to implement immediately and would simply require sending a company-wide e-mail to explain it.

--- REPORT SUMMARY ---
Miyoko Consulting
Woolf Flooring Report Summary
Thank you for allowing us to spend the last few weeks reviewing your operations. You will find a detailed expense-reduction report with projected savings in the pages that follow. Here is a list of our main recommendations.
1. Employees do not always use wood stains and other materials as efficiently as possible. More training time could be dedicated to this.
2. Employees could be more mindful of electricity costsâfor instance, turning off all lights and machines when not in use.
3. Several Internet service providers are offering special pricing right now. Switching to one of these providers could save a considerable amount of money in the long run.
4. More effort could be made to reuse suppliesâfor example, some basic personal protective equipment could be used more than once.`,

What Are Green Roofs?
Green roofs are an energy-saving option for office buildings and homes. A green roof is one that's covered with grasses, flowers, or other plants. It lowers heating and cooling costs while increasing a structure's aesthetic appeal. This Web site is designed for sharing ideas, photos, and resources to create and maintain a green roof.
Planting a rooftop garden is a rewarding do-it-yourself project, but special waterproofing and other preparations require the services of an experienced contractor. Costs vary widely by region, roof size, and complexity of the garden you want to create. Be sure to get estimates from at least two contractors.
If your contractor determines that your roof can handle the extra weight of soil, plants, and irrigation, ask about the project's timeline. Small, simple rooftop gardens may take only one week to complete.`,

What Our Customers Are Saying
Posted by Whitten Tech on October 20
Our team hired Osawa Corporate Team Building to lead an activity for the sales staff at Whitten Tech. The facilitator of the Scavenger Hunt, Lorenzo Benford, was excellent. The 28 members of our sales team all had positive feedback. They reported that they loved exploring the city, learning about its history, and finding new local attractions, even on a cold and cloudy day. I highly recommend this activity. The only downside was that we did not realize how far we would be walking. It would have been helpful to have an idea of the walking distances so we could have been fully prepared.`,
