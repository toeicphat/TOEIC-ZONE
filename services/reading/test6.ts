Eston Development Worth a Look
by Marcus Watanabe
"Ideal residential developments combine twenty-first-century convenience with small-town charm." That is the philosophy found in the brochure of the Homestead at Eston, a recently completed housing development just outside the town of Eston. — [1] —.
The community has wide streets, sidewalks, and three small parks surrounding a central square. The square features a café, a restaurant, and several shops. In the northeast corner of the development, there is an activity complex that includes a gym, theater, and swimming pool. — [2] —. "This means you never have to leave the community unless you want to," said Marjorie Solomon, sales director. "Once you visit, you'll realize why so many people are purchasing homes here."
While never leaving your development struck me as an odd idea, the Homestead planners deserve praise for creating a very attractive place to live. — [3] —. The planners have obviously prioritized the environment. Natural habitats have been carefully preserved, and homes and other structures have been designed to conserve water and energy.
Model homes are currently available for tours. — [4] —. Open houses take place 12:30-4:00 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays. Alternatively, appointments can be made by calling 856-555-0129.`,

Dear Ms. Palore,
Thank you for sending your estimate for the cement work on our apartment project in Smithville. The narrative accompanying your bid answered all of our questions, and my team was impressed by your firm's previous work and references. Your company is my first choice to take on the project.
Nonetheless, I still need budget approval from my director, Anita Cho. Your proposed price is a bit steeper than anticipated. I will be speaking with Ms. Cho about this tomorrow morning. Based on your company's reputation for outstanding work, I am confident that she will sign off on your bid.
I expect to get back to you by March 4.

Regards,

Comment: I saw the callout to local growers on your social media feed. A few years ago, I started a large community food garden with my neighbours here in Helensville for us to tend in our free time. This year, we have more plants than we can consume ourselves. Specifically, we have dozens of potted mint and cardamom seedlings as well as other uncommon herbs, and I wonder if you are interested in expanding your offerings of herbs. We also have a half dozen two-year-old lemon tree saplings that are between two and three feet tall.

Dear Ms. Dixon,
Pink Fern Gardens is always seeking uncommon plants. As for your citrus saplings, we are currently purchasing those from licensed growers only. There is a disease affecting certain varieties, so we must be cautious. We learned our lesson regarding this last autumn!
We do buy other plants from independent growers, as long as the seedlings are potted and market ready. Here are the types of seedlings we buy and the wholesale price we pay for each plant: ferns ($8), vines ($6), annual flowers ($5), and herbs for cooking, especially oregano, mint, and rosemary ($2). Please stop by at your convenience with samples of your offerings, and we can discuss our needs further in person.

Ken Yoneda

**Review from https://www.buyertobuyerintel.com/repair_services/electronics/computer_devices**
★★★★★ Elektroproof Repair
I spilled tea on the keyboard of my faithful old laptop, and while I dried the exterior rather quickly, I was afraid the internal components might have been ruined. Luckily for me, Elektroproof Repair came to the rescue! After booking my consultation on the Web site, I waited anxiously for a reply. Within an hour, I got an e-mail directly from the owner. Although the time slot I had requested was not available, when I responded to his e-mail to express how urgently I needed my laptop, the owner said they had an unexpected cancellation and asked if I could bring it in that very morning, which I did. Since my computer was not turned on at the time of the accident, an Elektroproof Repair technician was able to dry the computer's insides and prevent damage to the hard drive or internal circuits. Other than a new battery, no other part was needed, and Elektroproof Repair had my laptop fully functional and back in my hands within 24 hours.

Dear Ms. Rivera,
I am following up on the order you placed with us on April 23. We have only one guitar of the model you want in stock. It was used as a display sample on the floor of our salesroom here in Santa Barbara. This means it is out of the box and has been played by customers browsing the store. Our in-house luthier has thoroughly inspected the guitar, and it is still in excellent condition. There are no scratches, scuffs, or dents on it whatsoever. Because you purchased the instrument on the understanding that it was brand new, we want to offer you two options:
1. If you do not want the floor model, you may cancel the order and receive an immediate full refund.
2. If you would like the floor model, we will ship it immediately and offer you a 10 percent discount off the original retail price.
If you choose the latter, we will make sure the guitar is delivered to your local store in time for your first lesson there tomorrow. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Sincerely,
Krista Towers

Dear Mr. Merriweather,
Thank you for submitting your September invoice. I noticed that you neglected to charge us for developing the curriculum for your sculpting class, which you taught for the first time on September 25. I checked with Carol Swann, and she said that because invoice #00278 has already been paid, it would be best if you submitted a second invoice for the development. I will ask her to process it quickly when I receive it.
You will be happy to know that the feedback from your students was very positive. I will e-mail scans of their feedback forms later today.
