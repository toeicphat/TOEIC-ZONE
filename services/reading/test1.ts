Dear Ms. Ayala,

Thank you for selecting our business to provide baked goods for the Esplin Electronics conference event in March. We are honored that you chose us for a fourth year in a row! On March 29, we will provide a large vanilla cake for each of the ten venues you indicated, and we will deliver a custom-baked multilayer cake on the following day. You will be billed on March 28. Please review the attached order form and return it to me within seven days.

Regarding the cake you ordered for March 30, our head pastry chef will produce it according to your specifications. In fact, he created a sample of the complete recipe earlier todayâalmond crÃ¨me cake with fresh raspberry filling. We have judged it to be a delectable treat, and we are sure that you will be pleased.

If you have any concerns, just send me an e-mail. As always, we value your business.

I never had a dishwasher before. After remodeling my kitchen, I finally had room for a compact dishwasher. I did a lot of research, and the Dish Magic 300 seemed to be the best choice. It was pricier than other models, but all of the reviews were excellent. So, I decided to spend the extra money. I have had the dishwasher for one month now, and I could not be happier with my decision. Most importantly, the dishes come out sparkling clean, no matter how dirty they were going in. Also, the machine is so quiet, you do not even know it is running. Lastly, it is designed to use water efficiently, which is very important to me. Overall, I am very pleased with this dishwasher.

A colleague arranged for us to eat at Enriqua's while I was at a conference in Sydney. It is usually fully booked for dinner; you may need to call months in advance for a table. We had a wonderful lunch there instead. Everything was delicious, and the bread and desserts are baked on-site! It was a worthwhile treat before I flew back to Hong Kong.

Dear Ms. Savard,
Thank you for your kind offer to either pick up your online order from my shop or to pay extra for air or train transport. Neither arrangement is necessary, as I am happy to deliver your items to you in Stranraer myself. It so happens that my sister and her children live nearby in Kirkcolm. Before seeing them, I will drive my rental car to your house and hand deliver the items to you.
As you know, my merchandise is 100 percent handcrafted. If any damage occurs in transit, the repair turns into an expensive, time-consuming ordeal. Over the years, I've seen too much damage done by inattentive baggage handlers. My policy is to deliver items personally whenever feasible or hire a ground- or sea-based courier service I trust.
I look forward to meeting you on 5 June. I expect to arrive at your house no later than 5 p.m.

Sincerely,
Conor Boyle

Viewing the list of students enrolled in this class, I remembered chatting with some of you on the forum for January's poster design class. I look forward to sharing our learning experiences again for this class. Yesterday I was the second student to meet with Mr. Akpan for an individual videoconference about my business. I own a food truck from which I sell baked goods, and when I shared with Mr. Akpan the outline for my Web site, he suggested that I add a section with vivid images of all my baked goods. It was helpful advice.

By Rebecca Roats
NOTTINGHAM (1 August)âOrange Bay Kitchen has been serving up an infusion of Jamaican flavours in a laid-back Caribbean atmosphere for six months now. Managed by Keron Deslandes, the 150-seat restaurant is an aromatic jewel amid the bustling shops and eateries in Wester Square. The servers are always happy to help diners select from the variety of delights on the extensive menu, which includes curried goat, oxtail soup, and red snapper. The restaurant is most famous for its jerk chicken. Marinated for 24 hours prior to grilling and served with sides of stewed cabbage and coconut rice, the dish is a good deal at Â£12.
If you stop in on any Friday night between 7 and 11 P.M., you will enjoy live reggae music.

Orange Bay Kitchen: 2/5 Stars
After reading a glowing article about Orange Bay Kitchen by Rebecca Roats, I was eager to give this place a try. My husband and I arrived there at 7 P.M. yesterday, keen to enjoy live music with our dinner. Unfortunately, the band's performance that night had been cancelled. Undeterred, we stayed and both ordered the jerk chicken. While the chicken's smoky flavour was outstanding, the stewed cabbage was lacking in flavour. Also, the portion size was smaller than we had anticipated, so we ordered another appetiser to avoid going home hungry. The head chef came out to apologise and was extremely nice, but we will probably not go back anytime soon.

Dear Ms. Peterkin,
Thank you for visiting Orange Bay Kitchen and leaving a review. Our manager, Keron Deslandes, told me more about your visit and our failure to live up to your expectations that evening. Please accept the attached Â£20 gift certificate; I do hope that you will give us another try.
During your visit, our band had an equipment malfunction, which is what led to the last-minute cancellation. However, the band will be back performing weekly beginning in September. Also, I want you to know that Head Chef Adio Brown has changed the spices he uses in the stewed cabbage. I am sure you will find them delightful.

Hello Mary,
I received a query today from William Tesoriero at Tesoriero Remodeling. His monthly invoice for August never arrived.
As you know, Mr. Tesoriero was one of our very first customers. Since we first opened for business, he has made purchases from us on a regular basis. He is also a member of the Frequent Buyer Club. This is a customer we absolutely do not want to lose. I explained to him that the rollout of our electronic invoicing system did not go as smoothly as we had hoped and promised that this would not happen again.
I would appreciate it if you could please investigate the problem without delay and send the invoice for August to Mr. Tesoriero.
