BUSAN (15 October)—As international shipping continues to increase, companies that transport goods between continents have found themselves competing for expensive space on container ships. — [1] —. Delays in getting goods to factories and into stores have become more common. — [2] —.
As one of the biggest exporters of home building supplies in the country, Hibiscus Supply is particularly vulnerable to these issues. — [3] —. To avoid potential shipping problems, Hibiscus Supply has decided to operate its own container ship to export products overseas. — [4] —.
According to Hibiscus Supply president James Koh, operating the company's own ship should improve efficiency at ports and decrease overall shipping costs. Says Mr. Koh, "The cost to ship with freight companies has doubled in the past year. By shipping our products ourselves, we'll be able to avoid passing shipping-related price increases on to our customers."`,

Service Levels and Capacity: Zealandia Airlines provides regional service among four cities. In each case, average flight capacity exceeded the company goal of 85 percent.
On-Time Performance (OTP): For the purpose of measuring OTP, flights are considered "on time" when they reach their destination within fifteen minutes of the scheduled arrival time. Regional airlines are subject to fines when OTP drops below 50 percent. The following chart shows Zealandia's commendable OTP rates for the recent fiscal year.
| City | OTP |
|---|---|
| Kelton Falls | 52% |
| Grangerton | 68% |
| Satcherville | 79% |
| Barbour City | 64% |
Proposed Expansion: Zealandia Airlines provides regional passenger air service and is seeking to expand its fleet to begin providing commercial airfreight delivery. Establishing this service is a component of the airline's growth plan and corporate vision. The airline is currently in negotiations with aviation authorities to explore options.
Terminal and Service Improvements: Zealandia Airlines is participating in discussions with airport management about comprehensive renovations to its passenger lounge and café and has offered to commit $5 million from its budget to the project. Company executives have also finalized a plan and committed funds to overhaul its rewards program. The initiative supports the aim to be a leading service provider among similar airlines and capture an increasing percentage of the market share.`,

Dear Associates,
On December 3, our headquarters will close for a month for renovation. As all of you normally work out of these offices in San Francisco, please plan to work off-site and collect everything you may need (your laptop, files, etc.) before December 1. Entry to the building will be restricted after that date.
If you would like a temporary space at our San Jose offices, please e-mail me, and I will reserve one for you. If you plan to work from home and need additional equipment (such as a printer), fill out the attached form from our technology department and return it to me. A representative of that department will mail the equipment to your home address.
We realize this work on the building is a disruption, but timing it with our slow season should make the situation easier. We think you will be happy with the changes when the building reopens on January 5. If you have any questions, please reach out to me.
Best,

Plant tours are commonplace in many factories, but not all tours are as effective as they could be. Too many companies make the mistake of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach rather than tailoring tours to maximize their usefulness. A potential investor and a casual tourist will probably not be impressed by the same things, so it is best to be clear about the tour's purpose early on. Here are some guidelines to make each tour as effective as possible.
Be selective. Unless your tour is for a safety inspection, your guests do not need (or want) to see every part of your factory. Choose a few sections that will interest your guests and give them a better sense of your product. For example, journalists will want to create a story about your plant, so show them the parts of the plant that have historical significance, such as a room with the company's original production equipment.
Timing is everything. Always be mindful of the physical demands of the tour. Even the hardiest guest will tire of standing or walking for long periods. It is a good idea to schedule breaks in tours lasting longer than an hour. The time spent in a single section matters also. If you allow guests only five minutes in an area, they will soon forget it. On the other hand, even the most impressive room gets boring after half an hour.
Personality is NOT everything. While having a personable and friendly tour guide is essential, your guests are coming to see what goes into making your product. Tour guides get asked a variety of questions, some unexpected, so a comprehensive knowledge of the production processes is important (and absolutely vital during inspections). You also want someone who will keep the tour moving—visitors will appreciate a tour that begins and ends on time.

Hi, Masumi,
I have attached an April 15 article by Didiane Lessard to help you plan the tour we will be giving later this month. I especially agree with the section on timing. Since the tour, by necessity, will have to cover the entire plant, it must be conducted as efficiently as possible. As for a guide, I would have recommended Nathan Zarate, but he will be traveling on May 21. Perhaps Maja Clausen could do it. She has also worked here for several years; she is very knowledgeable about our facility, processes, policies, and procedures. I am confident that she will be able to handle any questions the visitors might ask.

**Testimonial from https://www.zonecatering.com/testimonials**
June 10—I have been in the acting business for over 25 years and am sometimes disappointed by the food trucks on film production sites. That was not the case today when we were filming Make the Meeting. The food truck had excellent coffee, and the strawberries in the large fruit salad were so fresh and tasty! Even though there was a long line of customers on an extremely hot and uncomfortable day, the server was able to get everyone's food ready quickly. She was friendly and easygoing, too! Even the food truck was pleasant-looking—the mural painted on the side of the truck was beautiful! I hope to see Zone Catering food trucks at future film shooting locations.

Dear Julia,
I will be attending the National Digital Marketing Conference this year as well! I love traveling to Dallas every year for this conference because it is a great networking opportunity. Since this is your first time attending, I recommend you go to the newcomers' reception on the first night. The conference executive planning committee is putting it on, and it could be an excellent occasion to socialize with other conference goers.
I will be staying at the Alessi Dallas Hotel. It is the closest to the convention center, and the rooms are comfortable. For you, I would suggest the one you already seem to prefer. It so happens that the newcomers' reception will be held in one of the event rooms there. It is a little farther away but still convenient. As a friendly reminder, we are advised not to book hotels with rates that exceed our company's limit of $175/night.
I look forward to seeing you in October. It will be lovely to catch up.

Dear Ms. Cam,
Thank you for your message. Your water might look cloudy on April 6 when you first turn on your faucets. We recommend that you keep the water running until it is clear before you use it. I assure you that the water is not harmful in any way. The minerals that cause the discoloration occur naturally, and our latest water analysis showed very high quality.
I apologize for the problem you described. I have fixed it, so you should not have any further trouble.
If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us again.
