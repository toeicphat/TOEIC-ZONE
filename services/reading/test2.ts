Dear Mr. Croft,
— [1] —. I have read your inquiry about offering financial management courses at libraries across Queensland. The Society for Financial Management Advisors (SFMA) welcomes the opportunity to partner with the libraries to make basic financial management information more widely available.
You proposed that SFMA members could lead introductory courses at several library branches. — [2] —. SFMA members have offered similar courses to recent graduates, people changing careers, and first-time investors in the past.
— [3] —. If you have a list of library branches that would host the first series of events, I can suggest facilitators who work near those libraries or would be willing to travel to them. Do you have a general profile of the expected attendees? — [4] —. That information would help us tailor the courses to audience needs and interests.
I look forward to meeting with you to develop a plan. Please contact me by telephone at 07 5550 1344 to set up a time to discuss the courses.

Subject: Your proposed changes

Dear Ms. Khoury,
Thank you for forwarding your proposed revisions to the contract for Qualiview Ltd. to be your wholesale supplier of automotive window glass.

First, we will gladly agree to an extension of the contract term from one to three years. Secondly, I am not sure what more we can do to address your concerns about packaging materials. We use custom-built crates and innovative packaging to reduce the risk of breakage during shipping. While we will replace any goods that may be damaged in transit, we do not agree to pay an additional penalty fee in the event of such damage.

I would like to discuss this further with you next week; however, I will be out of the office through Tuesday afternoon. Would you be available to meet before 11:00 A.M. on either Wednesday or Thursday? Friday is also possible. Please let me know a convenient date and time for you.

Best regards,
Karl Hagel

Shipping Disruptions
SINGAPORE (6 June)—Recently, the demand for international freight space has been outpacing the availability of shipping containers. This container shortage has led to higher costs for goods being shipped out of Asian ports. A drop in the production of rolls of steel, the raw material that containers are made from, has further complicated the situation. — [1] —.
Some exporters have considered the more expensive option of air freight, but companies are still faced with a difficult choice. — [2] —. They must either ask their customers to accept shipment delays, or substantially raise customer prices to cover the costs of expedited shipping. Either way, suppliers risk triggering customer dissatisfaction.
"We are working with business partners, investors, and government officials to discuss solutions to this problem," said Henry Lam, a spokesperson for the household goods producer QET Group. — [3] —. "It's going to take total cooperation of all stakeholders to find a solution."
Not all companies are suffering, though. For example, Fezker, the producer of athletic apparel and footwear, has implemented strategies to better overcome this situation. Fezker has successfully refocused its efforts away from exports to western countries and toward expanding its domestic and regional markets. — [4] —.
"We moved quickly, so the shipping container shortage has not caused a significant impact on our profits," said Fezker CEO Nuwa Lee.`,

Good morning, team. Can you share the current status of your projects, please?
Jing Yu (7:42 A.M.)
I met with the client last week to confirm the start date for Phase B of the Palisade project.
Robbie Zuniga (7:43 A.M.)
I am headed to the job site now for the Riverview project. The rain last week delayed pouring the concrete for the sidewalks. I will check the conditions this morning to see if the situation has improved.
Gary Wendel (7:44 A.M.)
When will Phase B of the Palisade project begin?
Jing Yu (7:46 A.M.)
We will break ground in March and plan to have the building completed by November.
Gary Wendel (7:47 A.M.)
That's good news about the March start date. I am sure the client is happy about that.
Gary Wendel (7:50 A.M.)
Robbie, let me know what you find out about the site conditions. Perhaps Nathan Burry can help at the site. He's our most knowledgeable concrete finisher.
Robbie Zuniga (7:55 A.M.)
Actually, I'm meeting Nathan at the site this morning, so I'll get his opinion on when we can pour the concrete. The rest of the project is on hold until we can do this.
Gary Wendel (7:57 A.M.)
Keep me posted. I don't want to rush it if it's still too wet. At the same time, the Riverview project is already behind schedule because of equipment problems and late delivery of building materials.

Will do.`,

From: Madalyn Kerluke <mkerluke@karabel.ca>

Subject: Taste-test results
Attachment: Fatior Labs survey results

Hi, Team,
I just received the 24-26 January survey results from Fatior Labs for our new ice-cream taste test. As you can see from the attached document, the results are very disappointing. We sent the four flavours that we considered to be the best, but none of them received high enough ratings to advance to the next stage of development. Most of the reviews were consistent among the 92 taste-test participants in our target market of consumers ages 25 through 40. It's not a big problem if a product gets low scores in colour in the testing phase, since we can easily adjust that in the laboratory. But we should never be sending out samples that are getting scores lower than 3 in the taste category.
I would like to meet at 9 A.M. on Monday (6 February) to figure out how to proceed. There is one flavour we may be able to work with if we make a few adjustments, as suggested by most of our taste testers. We will also need to get some new flavours to Fatior Labs no later than 1 March if we are going to get a new ice cream on the Preston Grocers freezer shelves by the beginning of June.

Fatior Labs Consumer Taste-Testing Survey
Date: 24 January
Company: Karabel Industries
Participant number: 54

Directions: You will be given a 45 g sample of 4 different ice creams. Please rate the taste, texture, sweetness, and colour of each ice cream on a scale of 1 (very unpleasant) to 5 (very pleasant). Please write any additional comments below.

| Flavour | Taste | Texture | Sweetness | Colour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lemon | 2 | 3 | 2 | 4 |
| Mango | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Salted Caramel | 2 | 1 | 1 | 5 |
| Peanut Brittle | 3 | 4 | 2 | 2 |

Comments: The fruit-flavoured ice creams were surprisingly sour. I did not care for them at all. I think the Peanut Brittle has the most potential, but it's missing something. I bet that adding chocolate swirls or brownie bits would make it a winner.`,

To Whom It May Concern,
Yesterday, I purchased some office supplies on your Web site. I received an e-mail receipt, but the costs are not itemized on it. To satisfy a new company policy, I must give my supervisor a receipt with the charges for each item listed separately. Could you e-mail me such a receipt? If not, is it possible for me to get this information myself from your Web site? Finally, can confirmations for future orders possibly be sent to more than one e-mail address? It would be ideal for my supervisor to automatically receive one.

Dear Mr. Nakashima,
Attached is the receipt you requested. In apology for the inconvenience, we will provide you with 10 percent off the total price of your next order. To view a full description of any previous order, first log in to your account on our Web site, go to the "My Orders" tab, and then click on any order number.
I noticed that included in each of your last few orders was an identical order for ten of a particular item. You should know that we will reduce the price for that item by 5 percent if you mark this as a recurring order. To do this, simply check the "Recurring Order" box on the online order form.
As for your final query, this is not possible right now. However, I will share the idea with our technical team.

All the best,

HONG KONG (18 February)—Crawford and Duval, the online retailer known for its handcrafted blankets, decorative pillows, and other household goods, has established four brick-and-mortar stores in Hong Kong. Last Monday, the company celebrated the grand opening of boutique stores in Causeway Bay, Discovery Bay, and Sheung Wan in addition to a large department store in Central District. While the boutique stores carry the most popular of the small household goods for which Crawford and Duval is famous, the Central District location also boasts an indoor plant department and an on-site café that features specialty coffees, teas, and light snacks. Moreover, it has a much more extensive selection of the merchandise than what is available through the company's Web site.

What Our Customers Are Saying
Posted by Whitten Tech on October 20
Our team hired Osawa Corporate Team Building to lead an activity for the sales staff at Whitten Tech. The facilitator of the Scavenger Hunt, Lorenzo Benford, was excellent. The 28 members of our sales team all had positive feedback. They reported that they loved exploring the city, learning about its history, and finding new local attractions, even on a cold and cloudy day. I highly recommend this activity. The only downside was that we did not realize how far we would be walking. It would have been helpful to have an idea of the walking distances so we could have been fully prepared.`,
