Dear Ms. Gil,
Regarding our telephone conversation earlier today, here in writing is the change I would like to make to Saturday's delivery.
I am requesting that you now deliver the flowers to the Grand Dining Room at the Kaltan Hotel instead of the Saji Banquet Hall. I apologize for this last-minute switch, but the banquet hall manager contacted me just last night to inform me about an electrical system malfunction that will require a weekend repair. Since the office party I am planning cannot be postponed, I have had to reserve this other venue.
I would appreciate receiving the delivery by 4:00 P.M.

Sumner Woodcrafting of Memphis, Tennessee, was established nearly 45 years ago by Kiran Sumner, with the goal of providing personalized service to customers seeking high-quality, handmade furniture. Now semiretired, Mr. Sumner still takes orders and responds to questions himself through the company's customer-service telephone line at 901-555-0185 on Thursdays and Fridays. Sumner Woodcrafting offers a wide selection of custom-made bedroom sets, tables, desks, cabinetry, and more—all made from high-quality solid woods.
Prices for handcrafted furniture are naturally higher than for furniture that is mass-produced in a factory. Because our master crafters do exceptionally fine work, our customers never regret spending a bit more for pieces built to last for generations.
Note that it can take up to two months to create a piece of furniture once it is ordered. Delivery fees are based on distance from our workshop. Unpacking and placing the item is available for an additional $50.

            text: `COLLINSVALE (28 March)—Over the last decade, instability in the pricing of raw materials has become the biggest concern for manufacturers. The issue now surpasses recruitment and technology, which had previously been ranked by businesses as the top two concerns respectively.
The reasons are not difficult to understand. For electronics manufacturers, materials typically represent 20 percent of all expenses, while makers of processed food can spend anywhere between 40 and 60 percent on materials. Thus, even a 10 percent rise in the cost of sugar can dramatically affect a factory's bottom line. Companies that can predict rising costs may be able to temper the effects of market volatility, but even the best forecasting cannot anticipate every change in the marketplace.`,

Subject: Assistance with Kishin XT20 digital recorder

To Whom It May Concern:
I purchased the Kishin XT20 digital recorder to record several days' worth of conference presentations. Now, after my first day at the event, I am trying to transfer the audio files to my laptop, but I am not having any luck. I have followed all the instructions in the user manual as well as the tips found in the FAQ section of the product's Web page. I have even tried alternative cords and the laptops in the hotel's business center, so I do not believe computer hardware to be the issue.
I am supposed to cover the remaining two days of this conference for work. My business partners expect me to return with as much information as I can. The Kishin XT20 digital recorder is of no use to me if I cannot properly share the files. Can you please help?

Hello,
My family and I were very comfortable in the family suite at the Sunny Welcome Hotel in Kolkata last year, and we were looking forward to returning this year for a week starting on 17 April. Unfortunately, we suddenly had to postpone our trip until June, so I called the hotel on the morning of 17 April to change our reservation dates. I thought everything was in order, but when I opened my credit card statement this month, I discovered an additional charge from the Sunny Welcome Hotel.
Could you please look into the matter? I believe that an error has been made and that I should be reimbursed. I would appreciate having the money credited to my account. We still plan to return to Kolkata later this year and anticipate an enjoyable stay at your hotel.
Yours sincerely,
Samuel Ramon`,

Subject: Next steps
Dear Ms. Sosa,
I have good news. The plans for the layout of the new Fountain Road office building have just been approved by Lanfei Chan at our corporate office. We now need to start thinking about the artwork for the main open-plan office area on the third floor of the building. This is one of our last tasks before the office opens in October.
I have heard that Red Starling Art has a good reputation for helping with office interiors. Could you look at the company's Web site today and find out if any of its services might be suitable for us? I am wondering whether photography or paintings would look best in the space. What do you think? I am still waiting to hear back from Maxwell Willis in Finance about the budget for art, so please do not agree to anything with Red Starling Art until we know more.
Thank you,

Subject: Employee survey responses
Dear Ms. Dixon,
I read through all the responses to the semiannual employee survey, and I want to highlight a few points that were repeatedly raised. We can use this list of suggestions to help determine our priorities.
Suggestion 1. A more flexible policy for working from home
Suggestion 2. An expanded in-office recycling strategy
Suggestion 3. More financial rewards for excellent work
Suggestion 4. More opportunities for technical training
Also, if you approve, I would like to simplify the survey form before we administer it again. The open-ended questions make the data difficult to analyze. I propose incorporating more yes-no questions or rating scales to determine how much a colleague agrees or disagrees with a statement.

Subject: Volunteers needed
I am seeking volunteers to form a committee that will launch an office recycling program. Having such a program was one of the most frequently identified needs mentioned on the recent employee survey. This program will prevent recyclables, including plastics, glass, metal, paper, and cardboard, from ending up in landfills.
Also, we need a volunteer to be the coordinator of this committee. I will be happy to meet with this coordinator to discuss first steps. Note that time spent on coordination tasks would be in addition to your regular work duties. A small amount of funds will be made available to be spent on program setup costs.

As chairperson of the In-office Recycling Committee, I am happy to report that we now have recycling bins in the kitchen for glass bottles, soda cans, and cardboard and paper. It took us some time to get this program started because finding containers narrow enough to squeeze three between the door and the refrigerator proved challenging. But I was finally able to purchase some.
Please note that the recycling facility we are working with has stringent guidelines on what they accept, so I am creating illustrated instructions to hang above each bin. Those will be up tomorrow, and committee members will be monitoring our collection system to make sure the program is going smoothly. Please contact me with any questions, concerns, or feedback.`,

**Review from Optical Centers Reviews**
Rating: 5 stars ★★★★★
I have been wearing eyeglasses since I was ten years old. I now have five children, and four of them wear glasses, so I have visited many opticians over the years. My recent visit to Kooper's Vision on August 31 was, by far, the best.
Ms. Palmer offered her help when she saw that I was overwhelmed by the eyeglass selection at Kooper's Vision. She looked at the shape of my face and steered me toward a few pairs of glasses that were perfect for me! She knew exactly what looked best on me and advised me about the size, color, quality, and cost of the frames I considered. Ms. Palmer also explained the different types of lenses and lens coatings available. I could not decide which was my favorite pair of eyeglasses, so I bought two pairs! I was incredulous when she told me it was her first day working at the store—she was the best optician I have ever had!

My company recently bought a gently used nonrefrigerated vending machine, which has been placed in our employee break room. I am looking for a stocking service to fill it so that the staff can start using it.
Does your company only stock vending machines that you own, or do you also offer a stocking service for other machines? If you can service ours, I would like to know more about the snacks you have available to fill the machine. Could you please send me a list of the products you offer?
Thank you for your assistance.

Dear Ms. Lewis,
Thank you for your e-mail. We would be happy to stock your machine even if it is not owned by our company. However, if your machine is old, it can be difficult to obtain parts for it, and older machines break more often. The cost of repairs can get high, making it more cost-effective for you to use one of our vending machines. Can you provide me with the model number?
I have attached the list you requested. We can accommodate special requests if you have any. I also recommend renting a drink machine from us, because we find that employees usually enjoy having a cold drink with their snacks.
Please contact me if you have additional questions.
