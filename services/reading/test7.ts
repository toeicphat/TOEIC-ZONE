To: All Employees
From: Management
Subject: Energy
Date: March 1

Dear Staff,
The Environmental Health and Safety Committee has requested your help in conserving energy. The committee recently conducted a walkthrough inspection of all offices and found that many employees are not in compliance with our company energy-conservation guidelines. — [1] —. Please take the time to review the policies listed in the attachment.
Energy conservation is vital for our company's success. — [2] —. A great deal of money is wasted each year because of inefficient energy usage. For example, leaving on lights at night and weekends costs us thousands of dollars a year. Last month, our building had a total energy bill of $23,450. The cost was $22,875 in the same month last year. We are hoping to reduce our energy consumption by at least 15 percent by the end of the year. — [3] —.
To reward your efforts, we will hold a special prize drawing when we have achieved this goal. We will update you regularly on our progress. — [4] —.
Thank you.`,

**International Trade in the Twenty-First Century**
The international trade landscape is constantly changing, so it can be difficult for a company to remain successful. A business must have a good product, smart pricing, and a strong plan for marketing and distribution. But the most valuable asset is information. Companies must know how to obtain accurate and relevant information about the business climate and to analyze that information effectively. For example, knowing the details of free trade agreements can lead to substantial financial benefits. It's often the case that an agreement between two countries will have an effect on a third country's business prospects.
For those who are not prepared to hire a staff of trade analysts, the Journal of International Trade and Commerce is a valuable tool. The publication, available online or in print, has recently expanded its coverage to include articles on a broad range of topics. A team of experts offers weekly summaries of key trends in international markets.`,

However, a few of the television channels we used to receive were no longer available. Also, we noticed that our room had been recently painted, but the new paint had a very strong odor.

Subject: Riverside Park playground
Dear Mr. Benoit,
It was a pleasure to meet with you last week. On behalf of the Riverside Association, I want to thank you for agreeing to present our playground renovation proposal to the city council. The current playground equipment is old and worn out, and we are also hoping to build a picnic area and plant more trees in that area. We look forward to hearing from you again after the city council has a chance to vote on the proposal.
Sincerely,

**CITY COUNCIL HIGHLIGHTS**
March 29—In a stunning move, the city council voted 10-2 to reject the Riverside Association's proposal to renovate the Riverside Park playground. After the Riverside Association's Anna Schmidt introduced the proposal, Councilman Charles Benoit urged the council to reject the proposal, which he called "fiscally irresponsible". "The cost is just too high," Mr. Benoit said. "There are too many other projects in our city that have a more urgent need for funds." He noted that the police department's request for additional funds to purchase body cameras for all police officers would be a better use of taxpayer money. Councilman Benoit, however, does not oppose all park improvements. He supports the Riverside Association's plans to build a picnic area and plant more trees and suggested that those projects would likely win council approval if they were submitted as separate proposals. He does oppose installing any new playground equipment in Riverside Park. The council will next consider the police department's funding request at its meeting on April 12.

**Riverside Association Meeting Minutes**
April 20—The board of directors discussed the city council's decision to reject the Riverside Association's proposal to renovate the Riverside Park playground. Ms. Schmidt suggested that the Riverside Association should hold a fund-raiser to raise the money to purchase new playground equipment. She pointed out that there is still some funding available from a grant awarded to the association last year and that the association can try to apply for more grant funding. The board voted unanimously to move forward with the fund-raising campaign, with the goal of raising $10,000.`,

I was hired as a junior designer at Lasky & Co. three months ago, and I absolutely love it! My coworkers are all very talented, and I've learned so much from my mentor, the head of men's accessory design, Kenji Tanaka. His advice and guidance have helped me immensely, and I've even been asked to submit some designs for the new line of men's belts we are currently working on. It's great to be part of a company that is always growing and that values the contributions of all its employees.

Dear Olivia,
Thank you for asking me to look over the résumés you've received for the lead designer position. As you know, Mr. Tanaka is moving from men's to women's handbags, but there's a lot of talent here. I think you've made the right decision to consider candidates from both within and outside the company. I was especially impressed with the application of Mina Sato, who currently works here at Lasky & Co. Although she only has three months of experience with the company, her résumé reveals that she has been working in the fashion industry for nearly twelve years, much of that with European clothing companies. In addition, I think her educational background in product development would be valuable.
Sincerely,
Isabella Rossi`,
