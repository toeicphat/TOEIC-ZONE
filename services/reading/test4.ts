What Are Green Roofs?
Green roofs are an energy-saving option for office buildings and homes. A green roof is one that's covered with grasses, flowers, or other plants. It lowers heating and cooling costs while increasing a structure's aesthetic appeal. This Web site is designed for sharing ideas, photos, and resources to create and maintain a green roof.
Planting a rooftop garden is a rewarding do-it-yourself project, but special waterproofing and other preparations require the services of an experienced contractor. Costs vary widely by region, roof size, and complexity of the garden you want to create. Be sure to get estimates from at least two contractors.
If your contractor determines that your roof can handle the extra weight of soil, plants, and irrigation, ask about the project's timeline. Small, simple rooftop gardens may take only one week to complete.`,

Book Review: Down the Mountainside
Reviewer: Camile Lin
Date: 15 May
Andrew Darr, the author of the best-selling series about detective Charles Martin, will be visiting our city this week, appearing at Neighbourhood Books to promote his new novel, Down the Mountainside. The new work sees Martin investigating mysterious events at a ski resort in the French Alps.
Darr's storytelling has come a long way since readers first met Charles Martin in The Doorbell, and this installment is Darr's strongest work to date. Fans of the stories will welcome the return of Darr's wit after a three-year wait, and newcomers to the Martin series are sure to find themselves captivated.
The story includes the right balance of suspense and humour, with an ending that is unpredictable, even to the most devoted Darr reader. I highly recommend this book to all mystery fans. You won't be disappointed.`,

Dear Mr. Ramirez,
I read the recent report from the Arizona Agriculture Division summarizing Yuma County's success in the citrus industry. City West Bank wants to help the Arizona Agriculture Division you lead by expanding this industry further. We offer low-interest loans and provide expert advice through our connections to area chambers of commerce and to agricultural researchers at Arizona's state universities.
We recognize that agritourism in southwest Arizona is growing as a result of the popularity of farm tours, bird-watching, and scenic country lodging, but tourism is unlikely to surpass the strength of this region's agriculture production. We support farmers in many counties in Arizona and are poised to help the citrus growers in Yuma County. Together, we can accomplish great things.
Cordially,

Modern Salon Academy Expands in Ontario
TORONTO (23 August)—Modern Salon Academy, a highly regarded beauty school here in Toronto, is opening a regional campus in Oshawa. The school is already admitting students for classes that are scheduled to begin on 4 October.
Modern Salon Academy has had a substantial rise in enrollment over the past few years. Francine Dupuis, educational director of Modern Salon Academy, notes, "More than half our students live outside the city limits, so having a satellite campus makes perfect sense."
