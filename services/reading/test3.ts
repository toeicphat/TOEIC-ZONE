This year's award was presented to Carila Corporation, a major player in the electronics sector. Under the direction of CEO Atsak Kakar, Carila Corporation went from near bankruptcy to a high level of profitability in just three years.
"Winning this award was very gratifying, not just for me but for the entire company,” Mr. Kakar said upon receiving the award. "Everyone has worked extremely hard to get this company back on solid financial ground. The long-term solution has brought exceptional value to our shareholders."`,

To: All Branch Managers
From: Fran Corliss
Subject: Survey results on mobile banking
Date: April 7

Hello all,
Ogden Bank recently conducted a survey of its customers concerning mobile banking. Here are some key takeaways.
Over 95 percent of our customers own a mobile device. However, although interest in mobile banking is high, only 39 percent of our customers use our application. Some customers cite security concerns (23 percent), but a majority (78 percent) say that they simply do not think the app works well.
A mandatory meeting for all branch managers will be held at our headquarters on April 12 at 4:00 P.M. to brainstorm strategies for responding to this challenge.

Best,
Fran Corliss
Director of Mobile Banking, Ogden Bank

Boost for Mobile Banking
By Edward Panzius
FLEMINGTON (May 25)—Ogden Bank has rolled out major improvements to its mobile banking application. It has expanded the variety of tasks that can be accomplished through the app and made it much easier to use.
"Many of our account holders have been frustrated in the past by a clunky, limited app," said Alys DeFreese, manager of the Flemington branch of Ogden Bank. "They can now do just about any task with the app that they could over the phone or by visiting a branch in person. This is just another example of how we support our customers in any way we can."
According to Ms. DeFreese, in the few weeks since the upgrade, 20 percent of account holders have switched to depositing checks and paying bills online. She anticipates that number will rise as more customers learn about the easy-to-use app.
"The convenience made a big difference for me," said account holder Yair Baum. Another customer, Maria Reed, added, “I appreciate the flexibility of being able to do my banking whenever and wherever I want."`,

Dear Ms. Calle,
It was delightful to see you leading the book club yesterday evening. Ms. Beck's Due North is lengthy, and it was a challenge to finish it before the meeting. However, I have to thank you for choosing that book because it revived my childhood interest in traveling to Alaska. In fact, I've already looked up some tours!
The club meeting was packed, and I hardly got to talk to you. We should catch up sometime soon. Perhaps we might try the new French restaurant on Looper Street. I hear it is amazing and reasonably priced.

Sincerely,
Gail Frey`,

To: Undisclosed Recipients
From: iqbal_grewal@woolfflooring.com.au
Date: 12 June
Subject: Cost-savings survey

Dear Colleagues,
At Woolf Flooring we are looking for ways to reduce day-to-day costs without sacrificing product quality, customer service, or staff morale. To this end, we are seeking input from select staff members in a variety of departments via an online survey that can be found at www.surveyquest.com.au/109820. Everyone who has been chosen to take part in the survey has been with the company for at least ten years and, therefore, is very familiar with our processes.
The deadline for completing the survey is 19 June. Note that this survey is for recipients of this e-mail only. Please do not forward this e-mail to others or post the link to the survey elsewhere.
We also plan to hire outside consultants to review our operations and write a report of their findings. We understand that some colleagues disagree with this approach to cutting costs; however, we have determined that getting an outside perspective is a worthwhile investment that will be likely to save us money in the long run.

Best,

Woolf Flooring Cost-Savings Survey
Based on your experience as an employee of Woolf Flooring, please provide one idea for a change that could be implemented to improve productivity and cut costs. Thank you.
Date: 18 June
Name and role: Beth Mair, sales manager
I have noticed that some employees grab a new pair of disposable gloves every time they return from a break. They could be using the same ones throughout the whole day. By limiting the use of gloves to one pair per day, Woolf Flooring would save thousands of dollars per year. Doing so would also reduce waste. A new policy regarding the use of personal protective items would be easy to implement immediately and would simply require sending a company-wide e-mail to explain it.

Miyoko Consulting
Woolf Flooring Report Summary
Thank you for allowing us to spend the last few weeks reviewing your operations. You will find a detailed expense-reduction report with projected savings in the pages that follow. Here is a list of our main recommendations.
1. Employees do not always use wood stains and other materials as efficiently as possible. More training time could be dedicated to this.
2. Employees could be more mindful of electricity costs—for instance, turning off all lights and machines when not in use.
3. Several Internet service providers are offering special pricing right now. Switching to one of these providers could save a considerable amount of money in the long run.
4. More effort could be made to reuse supplies—for example, some basic personal protective equipment could be used more than once.`,
