Hi, Ramdeo.
Please take a look at the latest draft and let me know what you think.

I haven't updated the prices yet though, as I haven't decided whether we will need to increase some of them. I'm sure you agree with me that the design firm did a great job upgrading the kitchen and making the dining room brighter and more inviting.

WILLETTVILLE (March 8)—Tanney's Discount Mart (TDM) announced today that it will hold a job fair in Willettville later this month. The company, headquartered in nearby Lyter City, is looking to fill 300 positions at its new distribution center, set to open here next month. In addition to seeking technicians and supervisors, the company wants to fill positions in the processing, stock inspection, and maintenance departments.
"TDM's distribution centers use modern automated systems, which creates a big need for qualified technical staff in particular," Kent Siler, TDM's president, said in a press release announcing the job fair.
The event will be held from 9:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. on Thursday, March 20, in the ballroom of the Twin Ridges Hotel. Details can be found by visiting tdm.com/careers.
"This recruiting event will help us find the staff we need to meet the anticipated growth in demand for our products," said Mr. Siler. "TDM continues to expand its position in discount retail. So far this year, we have opened three stores, and we have five more slated to open by the end of next year." Mr. Siler noted, moreover, that TDM offers competitive wages for full-time and part-time employment.`,

Amanda Richards (5:43 P.M.): So did I. I have mixed feelings about taking down that structure, though.
Desmond Williams (5:43 P.M.): This is the first time that I'm learning about that. I was out of the office all day today.
Rashaan Little (5:44 P.M.): How so, Amanda?
Amanda Richards (5:46 P.M.): Well, given that business has been quite slow lately, our company needs the work. Then again, the lighthouse has historic value: it has been a major landmark of Burlingate for 100 years.
Rashaan Little (5:48 P.M.): I realize that. But the company can't afford to pass up this opportunity for the reason you mentioned. Besides, lighthouses have largely become outdated.
Desmond Williams (5:49 P.M.): Not really. There's always a need for ships to get warnings about dangerous locations. Lighthouses have served that function for years.
Rashaan Little (5:51 P.M.): True, but modern technological equipment exists now that simplifies navigation and increasingly makes lighthouses a thing of the past. Anyway, let's meet tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. to discuss how we'll carry out this job.`,

Ms. Rosier credits the success to her commitment to lifelong learning. "Yes, my handcrafted soaps, shampoos, and lotions are luxurious," she said. "But there are a lot of high-quality skin-care products out there. So after learning the trade from my family, I have increased my sales knowledge by taking online courses in business-to-business (B2B) marketing."
Ms. Rosier adds that those courses built her confidence in selling her products directly to hotels. "Thanks to what I learned in my B2B strategies courses, I managed to persuade a number of boutique hotels in Europe to try my products." And so Rosier and Finch skin-care products are available in guest rooms at, for instance, the Bruadair Hotel in Galway, the Florinda Grand in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Zerra Inn in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Ms. Rosier further points out that many of her customers first learn of her products during a hotel stay. Afterward, they visit the shop in person or go online to purchase the items for themselves. Rosier and Finch is located at 12 Raven Terrace and can be found online at www.rosierandfinch.co.ie.

**Review: https://www.florindagrand.pt/en/guest_reviews**
I had to arrange a last-minute business trip to my company's Portugal office, and the usual hotel I book was completely full. Based on some online recommendations, I decided to stay at Florinda Grand. While this charming hotel is much smaller than the usual places I stay, it has every comfort one would want during a business trip. In addition to a tastefully decorated and comfortable room, there were gourmet treats on my pillowcase and the finest soap, shampoo, and other toiletries available for me to enjoy. My only regret is that I was in Lisbon for just three days. Next time I visit the Lisbon office, I will stay longer and book a room at the Florinda Grand.

**Popular Ice Cream Purveyor Comes to New Zealand**
By Ysai Mendez
ROTORUA (2 November)—Residents of Rotorua have been flocking to Cargill Street, where Margot's House of Ice Cream has opened its first store in New Zealand.
"I don't know what their secret is, but their ice cream really is something special,” said Jeremy Frank, a schoolteacher who was enjoying ice cream cones with his family on a recent afternoon. "We've been here several times already since they opened. I think we'll be regulars."
“I love strawberry, and their strawberry is the best I ever had," added his daughter, Olivia Frank, age 10.
Margot's House of Ice Cream was founded five years ago in San Francisco by Margot Summers, a former chemistry major. Its ice cream contains at least 11 percent milk fat. Milk used in production, according to company CEO June Willcox, is sourced locally or regionally whenever possible.
Kehinde Ilogu, the manager of the Rotorua store, says that the number of visitors has been rising steadily.
"We plan to keep the momentum going by having special events once a month," he said. "Next up is the strawberry festival. New Zealand's strawberry season will be getting started. In addition to our superb ice cream, we'll offer strawberries dipped in chocolate, strawberry cupcakes, and strawberry milkshakes. We look forward to a great future in Rotorua."`,

Thanks to your hard work, our new store in the Town Square Plaza is on track to open on June 15. One of the problems with the store we are currently working out of is that it is not on a bus line. By contrast, the location we will be moving to is served by bus number 689, so we expect to have a larger number of customers at that location. We are only waiting for the last of our display shelves to be delivered from our warehouse so that we can finish the display in the gardening department.

A recent consumer survey has shown that 33% of respondents prefer to touch the products they intend to purchase. Moreover, 61% of those surveyed said they are likely to spend more when shopping at a brick-and-mortar store rather than at an online store. These data, backed up by other consumer preference studies, are causing many merchants who generate all their revenue from online sales to open physical stores as a supplement to their online presence.
The advantage of a physical space is that it helps retail owners build brand loyalty. "In terms of convenience, nothing beats online," says Marlene Fitzroy, who owns Toddles, a children's store in Shelburn, and an online site, toddles.com. "But a physical space fosters a sense of community that keeps local customers coming back and attracts new ones."
Ms. Fitzroy, a frequent speaker at local business events, is not only a strong supporter and promoter of customer engagement; she also practices what she preaches. "Four times a year, we host a special sales event during which children can enjoy themselves with a variety of activities," she said. “These events are a hit with both the children and their parents. And even if the parents don't buy anything on such occasions, the next time they need a children's toy, game, book, or puzzle, they'll probably think of us."
