Hi, Ramdeo.
Please take a look at the latest draft and let me know what you think. I changed the layout—desserts are now on the inside back cover—and provided descriptions of the additional dinner dishes that you and your kitchen staff will be introducing next month. I haven't updated the prices yet though, as I haven't decided whether we will need to increase some of them. I'm sure you agree with me that the design firm did a great job upgrading the kitchen and making the dining room brighter and more inviting.

WILLETTVILLE (March 8)—Tanney's Discount Mart (TDM) announced today that it will hold a job fair in Willettville later this month. The company, headquartered in nearby Lyter City, is looking to fill 300 positions at its new distribution center, set to open here next month. In addition to seeking technicians and supervisors, the company wants to fill positions in the processing, stock inspection, and maintenance departments.
"TDM's distribution centers use modern automated systems, which creates a big need for qualified technical staff in particular," Kent Siler, TDM's president, said in a press release announcing the job fair.
The event will be held from 9:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. on Thursday, March 20, in the ballroom of the Twin Ridges Hotel. Details can be found by visiting tdm.com/careers.
"This recruiting event will help us find the staff we need to meet the anticipated growth in demand for our products," said Mr. Siler. "TDM continues to expand its position in discount retail. So far this year, we have opened three stores, and we have five more slated to open by the end of next year." Mr. Siler noted, moreover, that TDM offers competitive wages for full-time and part-time employment.`,

Desmond Williams (5:43 P.M.): This is the first time that I'm learning about that. I was out of the office all day today.
Rashaan Little (5:44 P.M.): How so, Amanda?
Amanda Richards (5:46 P.M.): Well, given that business has been quite slow lately, our company needs the work. Then again, the lighthouse has historic value: it has been a major landmark of Burlingate for 100 years.
Rashaan Little (5:48 P.M.): I realize that. But the company can't afford to pass up this opportunity for the reason you mentioned. Besides, lighthouses have largely become outdated.
Desmond Williams (5:49 P.M.): Not really. There's always a need for ships to get warnings about dangerous locations. Lighthouses have served that function for years.
Rashaan Little (5:51 P.M.): True, but modern technological equipment exists now that simplifies navigation and increasingly makes lighthouses a thing of the past. Anyway, let's meet tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. to discuss how we'll carry out this job.`,

Plant tours are commonplace in many factories, but not all tours are as effective as they could be. Too many companies make the mistake of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach rather than tailoring tours to maximize their usefulness. A potential investor and a casual tourist will probably not be impressed by the same things, so it is best to be clear about the tour's purpose early on. Here are some guidelines to make each tour as effective as possible.
Be selective. Unless your tour is for a safety inspection, your guests do not need (or want) to see every part of your factory. Choose a few sections that will interest your guests and give them a better sense of your product. For example, journalists will want to create a story about your plant, so show them the parts of the plant that have historical significance, such as a room with the company's original production equipment.
Timing is everything. Always be mindful of the physical demands of the tour. Even the hardiest guest will tire of standing or walking for long periods. It is a good idea to schedule breaks in tours lasting longer than an hour. The time spent in a single section matters also. If you allow guests only five minutes in an area, they will soon forget it. On the other hand, even the most impressive room gets boring after half an hour.
Personality is NOT everything. While having a personable and friendly tour guide is essential, your guests are coming to see what goes into making your product. Tour guides get asked a variety of questions, some unexpected, so a comprehensive knowledge of the production processes is important (and absolutely vital during inspections). You also want someone who will keep the tour moving—visitors will appreciate a tour that begins and ends on time.

Attachment: Lessard_article
Hi, Masumi,
I have attached an April 15 article by Didiane Lessard to help you plan the tour we will be giving later this month. I especially agree with the section on timing. Since the tour, by necessity, will have to cover the entire plant, it must be conducted as efficiently as possible. As for a guide, I would have recommended Nathan Zarate, but he will be traveling on May 21. Perhaps Maja Clausen could do it. She has also worked here for several years; she is very knowledgeable about our facility, processes, policies, and procedures. I am confident that she will be able to handle any questions the visitors might ask.

**Testimonial from https://www.zonecatering.com/testimonials**
June 10—I have been in the acting business for over 25 years and am sometimes disappointed by the food trucks on film production sites. That was not the case today when we were filming Make the Meeting. The food truck had excellent coffee, and the strawberries in the large fruit salad were so fresh and tasty! Even though there was a long line of customers on an extremely hot and uncomfortable day, the server was able to get everyone's food ready quickly. She was friendly and easygoing, too! Even the food truck was pleasant-looking—the mural painted on the side of the truck was beautiful! I hope to see Zone Catering food trucks at future film shooting locations.

Our maintenance fee, covering all four kiosks, is $120 per month. Our technicians will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to service the kiosks. All equipment will meet or exceed international quality standards, and all our work is guaranteed.
A formal written agreement will be sent to you by registered mail. We look forward to working with you.

Re: Move update
Thanks to your hard work, our new store in the Town Square Plaza is on track to open on June 15. One of the problems with the store we are currently working out of is that it is not on a bus line. By contrast, the location we will be moving to is served by bus number 689, so we expect to have a larger number of customers at that location. We are only waiting for the last of our display shelves to be delivered from our warehouse so that we can finish the display in the gardening department.
In appreciation of your efforts, I've brought pastries from Aniqa's Bakery. I've put these treats on the break-room counter. Enjoy!`,

Dear Kevin,
I recently came across a property for sale that may be of interest to you. I have made some initial inquiries and I believe that it may be suitable to turn into a guest house like the one you have in mind. Presently, the location would probably not attract many drive-by customers; although it is near a major road and a popular restaurant, the closest tourist area is a few kilometers away. However, the construction of an amusement park just half a kilometer away will be complete in January of next year. So it seems safe to assume that in the near future there will be an increased demand for hotels in the area. I'm emailing you a copy of the property listing. If you need more information, I will call the agency, request a tour, and have a look inside the property. If it meets your needs, we should try to make an offer below the listing price because I think the price is a bit high given the interior renovations that are required. But I must say that I'm impressed by the property's special features, which would be nice for attracting guests.
Sincerely, Deb Orth
