Thanks to your dedicated work, word of our little gym has spread. Over the past twelve months, enrollment has significantly increased and so has our teaching staff. Although this growth is wonderful, having to process the payroll by myself has become rather burdensome.

Also, you will now be able to get your pay stubs and tax information online. — [2] —.

Please complete the attached form and bring it to the office with a voided check no later than September 25. — [3] —. The new process will take effect in October. — [4] —. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Take care,

Re: Desserts
Dear Ms. Otero,
I just followed up with our baker about your request to have an assortment of desserts instead of one large cake for the party you are hosting at your home on November 7. We suggest ordering three dessert pieces per person. The cost for three desserts is between $10 and $12 per person. Our most popular desserts are the mini cheesecakes, the berry tartlets, and the brownies.
I know you are using a separate caterer for the lunch, and they will help serve and clean up after the party. You also mentioned that you were considering whether to put the dessert table in your backyard or inside your house. Just keep in mind that if you order the cheesecakes, they should not be left out for more than two hours. If you give us very specific instructions about where to set up the desserts, our staff can leave them in the appropriate place without disturbing the party.
Once you make your dessert choices, simply let us know how many guests you expect, and we can take care of the rest.

I am very happy with your work so far. Your suggestion to add photos from our archive certainly dressed up the "Company History" page. The help-wanted pop-up bubble on the home page also looks good. Hopefully, it will attract applicants with mechanical experience.
I'd like you to add one more project to our "Portfolio" page. We have finally finished replacing the plumbing and heating systems at Clary Medical Centre's satellite clinic in Galway.

Clinic opening soon
We have repurposed 47 High Street, Galway, into a satellite medical clinic and will celebrate with a grand opening party on Friday, 28 October. Remarks by Medical Director Dr. Celia O'Leary and local elected officials will begin promptly at 1:00 P.M., followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony and tours until 4:30 P.M.
Thirty miles from the Clary Medical Centre's main campus, the Clary Clinic is housed in the historic Brandmore shoe factory, which closed more than two decades ago. During renovations, care was taken to maintain the exterior's nineteenth-century architectural features. The clinic's interior boasts eighteen examination rooms, a state-of-the-art x-ray facility, private offices for patient consultations, and a lab for processing patient samples.
Clinic staff will begin seeing patients on Tuesday, 1 November. To make an appointment, please call 020 915 1424.`,

Dear Ms. Okiya,
We received your purchase order for the Blizzard walk-in freezer. Unfortunately, the model you requested is on back order and will not be available for three months. We regret the inconvenience and would like to offer you some options.
I can offer you the Blizzard BF600, which measures 2m x 2.5m x 3m, at the discounted price of $6,900 plus tax. It comes with the same features as the item you ordered.
Alternately, we have a refurbished BF400 in stock. It's the same size as the BF550; however, while the BF550 includes a remote control for setting the temperature, the BF400 has a wall-mounted device for that purpose. The BF400 unit comes with a two-year warranty. It is priced at $5,600 plus tax.
Please let me know how you wish to proceed. Just reply to this e-mail.

Nadir,
Thanks for your help with the corporate marketing plan. Attached is a link to the video created for us by Grindstone Marketing Group. It shows our 3-D printing equipment pouring fast-setting concrete, layer by layer. I think it looks great as is, and I believe it will be the most compelling aspect of our 1 June launch, especially if the Sheffield house is sold by then.
In case you haven't heard, our next construction project will be a home just a couple of kilometres from your office building!

House Constructed Using 3-D Technology For Sale
SHEFFIELD (15 May)—An international construction firm specializing in innovative building technologies has completed one of Britain's first 3-D printed houses. The new structure is located on Morgan Road in Sheffield.
KD Building Concepts took less than two weeks to execute the first phase of the project, which entailed printing the concrete walls and installing the electrical and plumbing systems, according to company president Olek Dzik. In just two months, the fully landscaped house with two bedrooms and two bathrooms was ready for market.
"Labour costs were cut in half thanks to 3-D printing technology," said Mr. Dzik, whose company has offices in France and Germany, as well as in Sheffield. "At KD Building Concepts, we are committed to building homes that are both affordable and luxurious."
The house was listed for sale this week by a local real estate broker. The asking price is £150,000.
Next on the horizon for KD Building Concepts is the construction of a home in Hamburg, Germany.`,

LOS ANGELES (March 20)—Fashion powerhouse Senano Designs announced on Wednesday that it had acquired Gendalla, an up-and-coming luxury brand. The acquisition is part of Senano's plan to supplement its clothing products with a line of designer watches. Over the next two years, the company has further plans to expand its offerings to include fragrances and luggage. Lina Pacheco, Senano's chief executive officer, said that such expansion is necessary to keep up and compete with other international fashion houses. Although based in Los Angeles, in recent years Senano has opened offices in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Miami. Ms. Pacheco says she was unfamiliar with Gendalla products until a year ago, when she saw one of their ads in an automobile magazine. “The products have a distinctive, modern style," Ms. Pacheco said, "which will go well with Senano's trendsetting clothes."

MEMO
From: Oscar Johansen, Accounting department
To: All Gendalla employees
Date: March 22
Subject: Travel expense policy
Attachment: Policy
I have attached a copy of Senano's policy on travel expenses, which will go into effect when we officially become employees of Senano on March 31.
Note that Senano's policy is more restrictive than Gendalla's policy in several ways. For example, employees will no longer have one month to submit expense reports. However, the new policy will make some processes much easier: specifically, Senano's requirements for submitting expenses under $50 are simpler than those under current Gendalla policy.
Carlie Dawson, an accounting director who works at Senano's headquarters, will come to our New York office to lead an information session about this and other policy-related changes on Thursday, March 28, at 2:00 P.M. I strongly encourage you to attend.
---
Senano Designs Travel Expense Policy
- To be reimbursed for work-related travel, employees must submit a travel request at least two weeks before a trip, listing the reason for travel and estimating all expenses.
- Original receipts must be submitted for expenses above $50. Any expenses below that do not require the submission of original receipts.
- All receipts and expense reports must be submitted within three weeks after a trip is completed. Expenses submitted after this time will require the approval of the department head.`,
