Dear Albert,
I'm attaching some sample pages from the upcoming summer catalog. I would like you to look them over. I think we probably have to redo the pages featuring the swimwear. The swimwear pictures look out of focus a little bit. We have to hurry on this, especially if we have to have the pictures retaken. I have to send the entire document to Donaustrica Printing by April 1 so that the catalogs can be mailed to customers on May 10.

**October 15th**
Dear Mr. Masterson,
I am disappointed that you have chosen to pursue this billing. I realize, as you pointed out in our conversation two weeks ago, that you believe you have the right to charge me because of your notice on your invoice. But this order, and my being overcharged, is the result of a typing error, and is not a typical return. It is clear that I intended to purchase only one Model 2000ce, as evidenced by my order of only 1 monitor, printer and accessory kit. Since the order was completed by phone, I unfortunately do not have printed documentation to support my claim. I do, however, have the confirmation number given to me over the phone by the person who took the order. That confirmation number is XL123-33A. I'm sure if you check your records you'll see that I am correct.
Furthermore, I refused delivery on the extra units, and I refuse to pay for products which I did not order and do not possess. Therefore, that does not make me liable for all the cost of their production, since I did not order them.
I am happy to pay the original bill of $2,226. If this is acceptable, please send me a corrected invoice and I will return payment. If you choose not to correct the invoice and pursue this billing, I ask that you direct all further invoices and correspondence to my attorney: James Clarke, Clarke and Associates, 642 Bayside Drive, Louisville, KY 93357
I hope this matter can be resolved without any legal involvement.
