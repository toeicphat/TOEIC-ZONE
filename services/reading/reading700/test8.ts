The dining area of the restaurant will be closed for the entire month of April, but the kitchen will be fully operational so room service will not be interrupted. Finally, cable television will not be available between 2 A.M. and 5 A.M. from April 5th through April 9th as we upgrade to fiber optic cables.

**Subject:** Purchase Order #83902-Superior Plumbing Supply

I am currently having difficulty with an order I placed with your company, Superior Plumbing Supply. I placed an order via fax on July 28th (Purchase order #83902), for a kitchen faucet (Model # MV600) and a shower head (Model # WT755). —[1]—. I requested that these items be delivered to the Robinson job site. However, a different kitchen faucet (Model # MV550) was delivered to the Robinson job site last Friday. —[2]—. Please make a note to have your delivery driver pick up this faucet when he or she bring out the correct ones.
—[3]—. As of today, I am still waiting on the kitchen faucet and shower head to be delivered. The Robinson house is ready to open but cannot until these items are installed. I spoke with one of your customer service representatives on Monday and she said the items left your warehouse last Friday and were delivered. However, I think they must have been delivered to the wrong address. —[4]—. Perhaps they confused my order with another. In any event, it is very important that you locate my order and deliver it as soon as possible. I have attached an original copy of purchase order and directions to the Robinson house for your convenience.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Ms. Karol Mitchell, 1714 Washington Boulevard, Canton, OH 44702
Ms. Mitchell,
Thank you for your interest in Stallworth Securities. I received your application, resume, and cover letter today. After reviewing your resume, I believe you are overqualified for the financial analyst position you applied for. Your qualifications are quite impressive and I think we may have a position that better utilizes your skills.
We are currently looking for an auditor to join our accounting team. I believe you are well qualified for this position as you have extensive experience in the internal auditing. I forwarded your resume to our Accounting Manager, Richard Harris, and he is interested in setting up an interview with you. Mr. Harris may be interested in speaking with your former employers, so I recommend bringing a list of references with you to the interview.
Please call me or send an e-mail at your earliest convenience to let me know if you would be interested in meeting with Mr. Harris about the auditor position.
Sincerely, Samantha Huber, Human Resources Manager`,

I enjoyed meeting you at the clinical research conference in Anaheim, California last week. Thank you for telling me about your company's opening for a clinical research supervisor. I believe I am very qualified for this position. As mentioned in person, I am currently a clinical research specialist at the Strickland University International Clinical Research Center in London. I work on a team aimed at understanding the biological significance of cellular processes. Additionally I serve on the European Union Scientific and Regulatory Committee of Clinical Research, which exposes me to important issues in our field. As my resume indicates, I spent several years in the United States, first as a biomedical student at Shepherd University and then as an intern at King Health Systems in San Francisco. The training I received at these institutions was very thorough, and living in the US enabled me to become fluent in English. My fluency in Japanese, English, and Mandarin Chinese is particularly helpful in communicating with researchers across the globe. As per your request, I have attached my resume and some clinical reports I have recently written. I will be traveling to your city next month and would like to stop by your office if you have time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.`,

**Re:** New advertising campaign
At tomorrow's meeting, we need to make a final decision on which magazine we will advertise in for Zing all purpose cleaner. As you may know, we previously discussed advertising Zing using direct mailers or on the Internet, but we ultimately decided on inserts that will be placed inside magazines. In preparation for the meeting, please take a look at the attached list of magazines. We originally considered 15 different magazines, but we narrowed it down to these five based on circulations, size, price, and insert limitations. The attached table shows the different options and criteria we must take into consideration as we make a final selection.
The genres of magazines are varied because cleaning products are used by everyone. Therefore, we are not targeting any specific readership. Management has indicated that they prefer the least expensive option. Although its circulation of 95,000 is less than the others, it has the best ratio of price to circulation and also limits the number of inserts. This means our advertisements will not have to compete with a lot of other inserts for the readers' attention.

| Magazine | Circulation | Frequency | Max Inserts | Rates | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sports Today | 180,000 | Weekly | 8 | $225,000 | |
| Home & Garden | 165,000 | Quarterly | No limit | $185,000 | Targets homeowners |
| Paparazzi | 135,000 | Monthly | No limit | $150,500 | Entertainment news |
| Discovery Earth | 125,000 | Monthly | 4 | $155,000 | Complimentary copy on airlines |
| Health & Fitness| 95,000 | Monthly | 2 | $120,000 | |

I've checked out the attached list. You recommended the cheapest publication but I don't think the option would be effective and suitable for our product, considering the potential readers. Rather, I think that the other magazines intended for home owners or many people will be more successful. I want us to reconsider this issue more carefully by the next meeting.`,

Dear Mr. Campbell:
On the weekend of April 25th, my son and his family will be visiting from Denton for my grandson's 1st birthday. As a gift for my son, I would like to schedule a baby portrait for Saturday, April 26th at your new Barboursville studio. Do you have any appointments available for that day? An appointment before noon is probably best for the baby. By the way, I was recommended to you by friends of mine in Charlestown and Blacksburg. They had family portraits taken in your studios there and said the portraits were fantastic and the service was top notch, so I'm hoping you will have time to schedule this photo shoot.`,
