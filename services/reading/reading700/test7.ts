**Howard County Public Pools Reopening in July**
June 10 — Howard County Department of Health announced that two of the swimming pools in the area have been renovated and are scheduled to open in July.
Last year the Plum Tree Pool Center was closed due to its failing of the quarterly water inspection. The pool's filtration system has been replaced with a brand new one and the pool will reopen again in July 15.
In addition, the expansion of the Columbia Pool Center has been completed. The city purchased more land to add a new 30-meter outdoor pool, adjacent to the existing one. New tiles were also replaced in the indoor pool, and a cafeteria, a fitness gym and an indoor tennis court were built in the center during the renovation.
The other recreation facilities in the county - Font Hill and Centennial - will begin renovations next season.`,

**Marcus (3:07 PM):** Oh, really? I didn't know that. Well, could you check for any other house available in that area with a similar layout?
**Patricia (3:10 PM):** Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. You know, Dartmouth Construction Company built all the townhouses on Pine Circle, so the layout won't be so different from one another.
**Patricia (3:12 PM):** If you give me your client's name and number, I will contact him and explain what happened.`,

Levitz, a Swedish writer, proclaimed in his acceptance speech last night that he was as surprised as everybody else. — [1] —. "I will be shocked for the rest of my life," Levitz joked to his audience of over 500. He also noted that "This is a great honor and I will be sure to cherish it forever."
—[2]—. Despite having written over 50 novels, the fifty-year-old writer has never enjoyed this much fame. He said “I'll be happy to sell even just a single book" when he released his first novel at the age of 20. During his 30-year career, he only had time to write in the evenings because he worked as a legal clerk during the day in order to support his family. —[3]—. He believes that he has not been able to reach a larger market because his books are more philosophical and not packed with action. But things are about to change. Since his award, he has received many offers to have his books translated into different languages, starting with his latest book, 'The Balance of Kingdoms'.
The Giller Prize is awarded to authors who have produced outstanding artistic and creative work related to social issues. —[4]—. It is named after Joahnn Giller, who established the award and continues judging the competition today.

Last Thursday was a landmark occasion for university students in Europe who are interested in finding a job in Greece. The first ever Career Fair was held in Athens. Over 60 companies sent representatives to the fair to offer talented students computer and information technology research positions in their firms. The fair started at 8 A.M. and closed at 4 P.M. About 350 students attended and many were given interviews on the spot. The coordinator of the fair says it was a great success and expects over 150 students to get jobs. He says the second job fair will be held in Volos on June 24.

Dear Mr. Carter, Director of Shipping & Receiving, Wired Inc.,
I have purchased computers and electronics equipment from Wired Inc. for over ten years now, and I have always recommended your store to friends and colleagues. Unfortunately, my most recent experience at one of your retail outlets was disappointing, especially in the wake of your latest internet advertising campaign.
I bought a laptop computer at your King St. location in Toronto on October 4, and when it arrived ten days later I found that the screen was damaged. I phoned the King St. location and spoke with the store manager, but was informed that the damage was likely caused during shipping, which Wired Inc. is not responsible for. He proceeded to inform me that I would be responsible for covering the cost of replacing the screen. I had assumed that Wired Inc. would pay for the screen, as it was obviously damaged before I received the laptop.
As a result of these complications, I am insisting that you cancel my order and provide me with a full refund. It seems to me that Wired Inc. should make more of an effort to satisfy its customers in the future.
Sincerely, Bruce Martin`,
