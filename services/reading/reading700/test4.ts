According to our records, you leased a car from us a year ago. With winter fast approaching, you might consider having the vehicle brought in for its regular maintenance inspection. We would recommend that you call or email to schedule a time for you to bring the car to our service center. The car you leased from us has a five-year warranty which includes annual maintenance checks to ensure that the car is running smoothly and any defects are repaired.
You should consider having your car inspected now even if it seems to be working perfectly. Simple equipment check-ups made now can save a great deal of money in repairs and replacements in the long run. Furthermore, you should not wait until the middle of winter to have your vehicle checked. It may take longer for us to schedule a service because so many others will be making similar appointments.

Dear Ms. Anderson,
I received your letter regarding the car inspection. With the exception of routine oil changes, the vehicle has not been looked at since I signed the lease just over a year ago. So now would definitely be a good time to have it serviced. The car does not seem to be running as efficiently as before. I believe the brake pads in particular need to be looked into and possibly replaced. Will you be able to schedule an appointment sometime within the next ten days?
I would also like to look into replacing the all-season tires with some winter tires. Could you please provide a quote for how much this would cost, including installation? Please contact me at 718-555-2369 to confirm a specific time for my appointment.
Thank you.

As you may already know, we have recently formed a company basketball team. About ten people have joined so far, and we have been playing every Saturday at the Swift Creek High School Gym for the last few months. After receiving your e-mail about the company's Year End Party, I immediately realized that we have a game scheduled for the same date at 6 P.M. I know everyone involved will want to attend both events but I don't think we'll be able to reschedule the game. Would it be possible to change the date of the Year End Party instead? If you are willing to consider it, I would be happy to help make the arrangements and check the availability of the hotel banquet halls.

That's why we have worked diligently over the past three years to ensure that our employee exercise facility is in excellent condition. We want our fitness center to cater to your needs. Over the past few years, we have purchased modern exercise equipment, renovated the men's and women's locker rooms, and developed our well-known exercise and diet program, "For Your Health and Well-being".
We would like to thank everyone who took part in our annual survey about the fitness center. Based on your suggestions, a few changes will be made. These will go into effect on January 1 of next year. Most importantly, we are extending our weekday hours; now the center will remain open for an extra three hours from Monday through Thursday. Also, long-time members will be pleasantly surprised to know that our most popular personal trainer Jenna Sanchez is to be the new manager of the fitness center.
We would like to encourage more employees to take advantage of our fitness center and programs. Memberships, as always, are subsidized and cost only $15 monthly. Further, for a limited time, we are offering a special introductory rate for new members. If you sign up by December 31, you will only be charged $10 per month for the first three months. Contact Jenna Sanchez to learn more information.

**Subject:** Guest house location

Dear Kevin,
I recently came across a property for sale that may be of interest to you. I have made some initial inquiries and I believe that it may be suitable to turn into a guest house like the one you have in mind. Presently, the location would probably not attract many drive-by customers; although it is near a major road and a popular restaurant, the closest tourist area is a few kilometers away. However, the construction of an amusement park just half a kilometer away will be complete in January of next year. So it seems safe to assume that in the near future there will be an increased demand for hotels in the area. I'm emailing you a copy of the property listing. If you need more information, I will call the agency, request a tour, and have a look inside the property. If it meets your needs, we should try to make an offer below the listing price because I think the price is a bit high given the interior renovations that are required. But I must say that I'm impressed by the property's special features, which would be nice for attracting guests.
Sincerely, Deb Orth

Hello, Mr. Orth. I've got your e-mail and the related information. That is very helpful to me. By the way, I was wondering if we can get more parking spaces. I think it's better for each room to be provided with at least 1 space for parking. If it is possible, the property would be quite good. Please let me know about this issue as soon as possible.
