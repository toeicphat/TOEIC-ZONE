To Whom It May Concern,
For the past 6 weeks, we have had the pleasure of having Michael Spencer in our resort as an English teacher. — [1] —. I have received nothing but excellent feedback from our staff about his classes which are said to be very engaging, interactive, and most of all fun. — [2] —. Michael has built a great rapport with his students. He is liked by everybody here at Chaweng Oceanfront Resort and I have received many requests for his return next year to continue his teachings.
Personally, I have noticed a great improvement in English in our staff. I am also very happy with the increase of their test scores. — [3] —. Not only did he focus on English in his classes but also on customer service, which is especially noticeable in our front desk and restaurant staff. I can say with confidence that Michael has exceeded our expectations.
It has been a pleasure getting to know Michael, and I highly recommend him as a trainer in any resort. — [4] —. I hope to work with him again very soon and this is a feeling I share with all the staff here at Chaweng Oceanfront Resort.

San Francisco (November 17) – A women's clothing chain that recently opened a store at 2806 Rinesford Street is filling a niche that has been largely overlooked by other retailers. The Fantastic Fashion clothing chain is owned and operated by Victoria Nelson, a former fashion model with extensive industry experience. Noting that high-end boutiques are plentiful in San Francisco and most other metropolitan areas, she said, “My mission is to make the latest fashion designs affordable to all women, especially those who want to look great but can't afford designer prices."
Ms. Nelson does this by selling clothes and accessories created by relatively unknown but talented fashion designers who are new to the marketplace. By doing this, she has been able to deliver the combination of high fashion with reasonable prices. “My customers like the notion that they're helping new designers get attention,” she said.
Local resident, Ashley Buck, who works as an administrative assistant, said her co-worker complimented her on an outfit she purchased at Fantastic Fashion last week, so she returned this week to add some more items to her wardrobe. She said, “The salespeople are always helpful in suggesting styles that are flattering my figure.” The dress Ms. Buck purchased was designed by Natalie Rosenbaum, 26, a recent graduate from the Fashion and Design Institute in New York.
The first Fantastic Fashion store opened in Chicago last year and a second store opened in Boston in May. The San Francisco store opened last month. Another store, to be located in Seattle, will open at the end of this month. Ms. Nelson said she hopes to enter the international market with a store in Milan within the next three years.`,

ICA, a global organization whose membership includes many critically acclaimed architects, recently announced its 10th annual architectural awards. This year, the focus of the awards was aimed at the environment since ICA added 2 new awards: the Green Building Award and the Cooper Environmental Design Award, named after renowned architect and pioneer Mr. Andrew Cooper, who dedicated his career to conserving nature with his designs and was the former President of the Green Project Council. A panel, composed of members that are recognized professionals in their own fields of architecture, business, education, publishing, and culture, deliberated the nominations and the winners were announced at the awards banquet. Deserving special attention was the Cooper Award won by Smith and Haigh Studios. This firm, based in San Francisco, has focused on the environment for the past 7 years and has attracted a great deal of attention in the industry and set future standards very high in architectural design.

I was also wondering if you have any vegetarian meals on your room service menu. My wife doesn't eat meat, and we enjoy ordering from room service so hopefully your hotel has some reasonable options. I apologize for any inconvenience this last minute upgrade may cause. My wife and I are really hoping you'll be able to accommodate our request. We've always wanted to experience the view of the French Quarter from our room. We have close friends who stayed in this room a couple of years ago and highly recommended it.`,

The downtown bus service that connects the east and west sides of the city recently removed the bus stop for southbound service on Emerson Avenue near Tall Street. (The northbound bus stop is still in place.) The removal allows developers of the new 30-story condominium at Marveling Terrace to occupy the sidewalk on that part of Emerson Avenue for construction access. As an alternative transportation option, city residents can catch the downtown bus heading eastbound on Tall Street, mid-block between Emerson Avenue and Helm Street. The downtown bus route connects Avery Street Seaport with Hobson City, making stops at many important destinations. Since it's free, you can hop on and off as often as you like.

**Operational Information**
- Service is provided seven days a week.

- Stops along the route include Hobson City, Avery Street Seaport, and dozens in between.
- **Please note:** Passengers are permitted to carry bundles, packages, folded baby strollers, folded shopping carts, etc. aboard our buses except during the hours of 2 P.M. - 7 P.M. or when/where it would cause inconvenience to other passengers or block the aisles.

The river-facing west wing will rise 14 floors above street level, and the city-facing east wing will rise 13 floors; both will feature landscaped roof gardens and sitting areas for building residents and their guests to enjoy.

I have recently purchased several pieces of miniatures to decorate my clothing store. When I received the kit, I was delighted to find that the model showed all the details of the original's construction and nothing was damaged during the shipment. The products that I had to assemble were challenging to put together. However one item (#48321) did not arrive with assembly instructions. My customer ID number is 3367 and Order ID number is 5128.
