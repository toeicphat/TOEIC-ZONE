**Publication acknowledges Henman Financial**

Henman Financial has been featured in the popular weekly publication as one of the highest grossing financial service firms in Europe. —[1]—. President and CEO Andrew Henman had worked as an Executive VP at Euro Alliance in Munich before launching his own firm over twelve years ago. After achieving record profits at Euro Alliance, he decided to start his own business in his native city of London. —[2]—. Since that time, his firm has expanded into an international conglomerate with services offered in almost every major market across Europe and Asia, including Barcelona, Zurich & Tokyo. —[3]—. As London Report on Business reported last week, that office will likely be located in New York City. —[4]—. UK Commence also discussed that Henman Financial's key to success has been to retain its employees and reduce turnover, which keeps their customers happy and has resulted in revenue levels that easily surpass the competition.`,

Dear Marie,
I'm glad that you have agreed to take my place and attend the annual Hospitality and Tourism Conference next month in Dallas. I really enjoyed the conference last year in Minneapolis and made some new contacts in the industry. I regret not being able to attend this year because some of my overseas clients will be in town that week and I need to meet with them here in the San Francisco Office. I've spoken with our travel department and informed them to change all of the reservations from my name to yours. Your flight will leave San Francisco on Sunday, November 5 at 12:00 P.M. and arrive in Dallas at 2:45 P.M. local time. The flight, rental car and hotel room will be paid in advance by Royal Resorts, Inc. You will also receive a daily allowance to cover the costs of your meals, but you will not be reimbursed until you return. Please be sure to save all of your receipts and submit an expense report when you get back.
The schedule for the conference seminars is as follows:
* **On Monday:** 9:30 A.M. – 12:00 P.M.: International Tourism | 1:30 P.M. – 4:00 P.M.: Hospitality Marketing
* **On Tuesday:** 9:30 A.M. – 12:00 P.M.: Food Service Management | 1:30 P.M. – 4:00 P.M.: Lodging Service
Have a safe trip and enjoy the seminars!

By the way, the seminar on Food Service that was scheduled for Tuesday morning was cancelled due to the small number of attendees.
Thank you again for the opportunity to go and please let me know if you want to discuss anything from the conference.
