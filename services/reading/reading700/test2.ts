Business travelers and their companies are concerned about hotel room rate increases. Rooms have risen 12% in New York from a year ago to an average of $199 a night. Similar trends can be seen in Detroit, up 15%; Los Angeles, up 7%; Houston, up 6%. With the business climate improving, hotels are charging higher prices, but companies that spend millions on business travel are developing new strategies:

- **Less Luxury** - A health sciences company says they encourage employees to stay at limited-service hotels, rather than pricier four-star properties.
- **Discounts** - One manufacturer believes that employees should use member discounts from auto club, credit card, senior status, etc.
- **Corporate Apartments** - A US branch of a Tokyo firm says a corporate apartment can save as much as 40% over a hotel room.

Hotels that continue to increase rates will most likely lose business to budget hotels, corporate apartments, etc. Business was bad for hotels after the terrorism wave, but it has been rebounding. So, to make up for their economic damage in the past, most major hotels are now proposing double-digit increases. Because of such a trend, even some relatively modest hotels have raised rates.

Paying $450 a night for a simple room in Manhattan stands out on a corporate expense report, ending up more costly than airfare in some cases. Airlines long to raise their rates, but increased capacity and severe competition prevents them from doing so. Hotels, on the other hand, can't expand capacity easily, so increased demand tends to drive prices up.`,

The updated guidelines are listed below. — [2] —. I will distribute a final copy to each of you by the end of the week. — [3] —. It is imperative that you strictly enforce these guidelines as preventing accidents is better than dealing with the problems caused by negligence. — [4] —.

- Hard hats must be worn on job sites at all times. No exceptions!
- Safety rails must be put up immediately following the installation of the stairs. Some contractors are waiting a few days, which is unacceptable.
- Portable propane heaters may be used to help dry the sheetrock but the gas tanks must be outside the house.
- No one is allowed to work on the roof if it is raining. If it starts to rain, you must check each house under construction to make sure no one is on the roof.`,

I am writing to request your permission to use the costume worn by one of the actors in the movie Renaissance, which was released by Gold Pictures in 1985 and won that year's award for the best costume design at the American Screen Actors Awards. I will arrange for a courier to pick up and return the costume, ensuring that it is displayed under proper conditions and so that it is cleaned by a costume preservation expert before it is returned to you.

To Whom It May Concern:
I stayed at the Wyndham Hotel from January 12th to 15th. Because I was in a hurry to catch the 7 A.M. airport shuttle, I used the in-room express check-out on the television. At the time, I didn't carefully review the charges. However, after receiving the itemized bill via mail at my office, I noticed an inaccurate charge.
At the time I made my reservation online, there was a promotion for online reservation for free shuttle service to and from the airport. However, my bill shows that I was charged for a round trip on the shuttle. Therefore, I would like the overcharged amount credited back to my company credit card.
As always, I had a pleasant stay at the Wyndham Hotel. I am sure this mistake was just an oversight. I appreciate your attention to this matter and I'm confident it will be resolved in a timely fashion.
Sincerely, Carl Jackson`,
