Dear Ms. Blankenship,
I enjoyed speaking with you about a fitness instructor position at In-Shape Fitness Center. I would like to offer you a full-time position beginning in March. Currently, we offer aerobics, yoga, and cycling classes. Since your specialty is pilates, we want to feature some new pilates classes taught by you in the spring.

I would also like to see if you would be interested in substitute-teaching in the meantime to fill in for our yoga instructor who is scheduled to be on vacation in February. This will help you familiarize yourself with our facility before your classes begin in March.

I am looking forward to working with you. We feel that your teaching experience will be a valuable addition to our center. Please contact me at 387-423-7769 by the end of January so that we can set up a time to finalize your paperwork and make your spring class schedule.

Sincerely,
Julie Hawthorne, Director`,

In David Tanner's book, *Office Etiquette Do's and Don'ts*, Tanner offers great advice on how individuals can avoid conflicts in the workplace by following some simple guidelines. — [1] —. Mr. Tanner argues that many employees have their bleak future and eliminate themselves from considerations for their promotion because of their inability to manage their office behavior effectively.

For instance, whenever you have issues in the workplace, you're better off thinking through your words before you voice complaints, thoughts, or suggestions. Assess the situation carefully. — [2] —. If the gains outweigh the losses, proceed in a professional and polite manner. In the instance, you do find yourself in a workplace conflict, be sure to protect yourself with thorough documentation. — [3] —. A smart employee will document issues that relate to self-preservation and protection of job security.

Mr. Tanner is a workplace psychologist and bestselling author who has won numerous awards for his research and writings on workplace issues. — [4] —. Two of his earlier books have sold more than one million copies worldwide. *Office Etiquette Do's and Don'ts* has already sold 20,000 copies since being released by Bramberton Press only five months ago.

Dear Teresa,
I just placed the order for the awards and I am sending you the details, as requested. I ordered a platinum crystal trophy engraved with the company logo, recipient's name, and a personal inscription for the developer award. For the researchers, I ordered three plaques engraved with the company logo, recipient's name, and a personal inscription.

The awards come individually wrapped, and they are due to arrive by the end of next week. I am sending over a copy of the order confirmation to your office for your records. As we discussed previously, the developer award will be accompanied with a $1,000 bonus check, which will be included in an envelope containing a letter from the company president.

Regards,
Curtis`,

Dear Tim,
It has been brought to my attention that several negative reviews about our new Screen Touch Phones have been posted on popular electronics product review websites. Two of those websites are www.electronicreviews.com and www.productinfo.com. The complaints seem to be about the battery life of the phones.

We need to move quickly to address this problem because the Screen Touch phones are a very important part of this year's marketing campaign. To adequately address this matter, however, we need more details. Can you have your team do some research for us on this issue?

Also, please find out if our customers have any other concerns about the Screen Touch product line. I'd appreciate it if you could get back to me with an initial assessment by the end of next week.

Thanks for your help.

**Subject:** Vista Screen Touch Phones
**Date:** March 9

Dear Courtney,
We've done some research into the problem you mentioned in your e-mail on March 3. We have found that customers indeed are not satisfied with the battery life of the Screen Touch phones compared with other models. The battery seems to be running out in less than two hours of talk time. Fortunately, it seems that the problem is mostly restricted to the ST 750 model. So, you and other managers in product development need to address this problem.

In addition, there seems to be some dissatisfaction among buyers with the Screen Touch ST 1000 model. Customers are not happy with the antenna's signal strength; they are reporting a higher rate of dropped calls than a normal one. I'll send you a more detailed report of our findings within a week.

There is some good news, however. Our market research indicates that customers are quite satisfied with the price and features of both of these models. So if your teams can solve the problems we have indicated, I think things will be just fine.

Tim`,

**Name:** Dane Green
**Sessions attended:** [X] Critical Thinking, [ ] Situational Leadership, [X] Collaborative Leadership, [ ] Leadership for Women

**Which session did you find the most helpful? Why?**
Not only the critical thinking was the most effective of all sessions but it was also very entertaining as the speaker allowed me to think out of the box with the lateral thinking questions listed on the sheet he gave us. This session was especially helpful for me since creative thinking is an essential skill in advertising, and I also learned about new ways to approach problems that may occur in my department.

**How could the courses be improved?**
It was mentioned in the schedule that we may be let go just a bit past the scheduled time, but the session on August 19 ended fifteen minutes late. I ended up showing up late at a meeting I scheduled for 2:20. If the speaker does not exceed their given time, it would be much more helpful.`,
