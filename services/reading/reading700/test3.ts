The airline's first flights are scheduled to begin on May 15th and will fly between New York and Los Angeles. In July, Value Plus will add service from New York to Dallas and to Seattle. Tickets can be purchased by phone or on the company's web site. However, to keep costs low, they are not available through travel agencies. Unlike most other airlines, Value Plus allows travelers to check two pieces of luggage at no extra charge. It also advertises no change fees to reschedule your flight for a different date. Even though it is a budget airline, it still offers free non-alcoholic drinks and snacks. According to Value Plus representatives, it will offer low priced meal options beginning in June. In addition, it claims to offer fast automated check-in procedures at the airport.

Dear Mr. Bryant:
I flew on Value Plus Flight 105 on May 17th, and of course, I was looking forward to affordable, fast, and reliable service as advertised by Value Plus Airlines. Although my flight left on time and I enjoyed the complimentary in-flight refreshments, the speed of the check-in process did not meet my expectations. I arrived at the airport an hour and a half before my flight, but several of the automated check-in machines were not working, which caused me to have to wait in line for almost 50 minutes. This caused me to nearly miss my flight. I understand you are just getting started but I hope these problems will be rectified before my next flight to Los Angeles on June 5th. If not, I will most likely take my business elsewhere.

Sheila Primrose`,

Dear Ms. Ferguson,
Since our most recent inspection, we have had several difficulties using our Prestige Laser Printer. I raised the issue with the technician when he was here last for the contractual inspection and maintenance on August 15. The technician informed me that the problems we were experiencing were the result of a faulty part and that he would complete a diagnostic report for us. Unfortunately, since then we have not heard anything more about this report.
Since our next inspection will not occur for another four months, we would like to have your technician return to our offices and complete the repairs as soon as possible. Please inform us as to the earliest date a technician can visit our location.

Hi Ricardo! I just saw on the CIP website that you recently won the company's Most Outstanding Employee Award for this year. Congratulations! It's definitely well deserved and indicates how much you are appreciated at CIP.
Things have been going pretty well for us since I left CIP and moved to El Paso. My husband really loves his new job so far, and we found a really cute house to rent. I'm currently working at a local engineering firm called Affinion. The office is only a five-minute drive from our home, but I'm not fully satisfied with it since it's neither exciting nor financially rewarding.
Therefore, I've been searching for a job opportunity that better suits my interests. I recently interviewed for a promising position with a commercial real estate company. They seem quite interested in me and have asked for a professional reference. I was wondering if you would be willing to fill out the attached form and return it to them. I can't think of anyone better to evaluate my qualifications, skills, and character. I really appreciate your help. Please tell everyone at the office my best.
