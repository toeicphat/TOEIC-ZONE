The Marina Restaurant reopened recently with a new look and ambience. The formal dining atmosphere has given way to a relaxed setting more in tune with the new millennium. The 'new' Marina Restaurant is full of beautiful, vibrant colors and fabrics. An assortment of paper lanterns from Tibet, Bali, and Thailand hang from exposed beams, infusing the place with a warm, cozy glow.
The dark wood panels and the black and white uniforms of the old Marina are a thing of the past, but the restaurant's tradition of providing high-quality food still remains. With Chef Pak Theo's menu of innovative Italian cuisine and Sharifah Ainun's sumptuous Malay buffet, the restaurant continues to offer the best Western and local cuisine. The service continues to be the most attentive in town.
"The restaurant still offers the best selection of both Western and local fares", says proprietor Brian Tan. "And you never have to wait more than 15 minutes for your meals. That makes us the top choice for the lunchtime crowd for miles around."`,

Huan Samuels, president and CEO of Delta One Investment, today announced on behalf of executive board members the creation of a new position: vice president for International Affairs. "We have had a committee specially designated for this project hard at work for the last three months. Mike Yang finally got back to me today with the final decision. We're going to go with an outsider — John Racine of Black Securities. We offer our warmest congratulations."
The company has been going through a period of unprecedented growth, and has been said to be hampered by a lackluster overseas program. The creation of this new position should help remedy that situation, although it is unknown if the chosen vice president will be able to adapt his domestic experience to the international market. Keeping up his optimism, Samuels said of the appointment "I trust the Yang group's decision implicitly. When the board assembled them for this task, I said that their choice would be final, and it is."`,

Dear Mr. Kresky,
I have been renting a one-bedroom apartment in your building on Maple Boulevard for the past 2 years. Overall, I have had a pleasant experience living here. However, on April 6, the electrical system in my apartment stopped working. I contacted the manager, Ms. Myers and she sent a maintenance person to fix the problem the following day.
After spending three hours trying to repair the system, Mr. Simpson told me that he needed to order a part in order to fix the system correctly. It took 5 days for the part to arrive and be installed. While I acknowledge Ms. Myers and Mr. Simpson did everything they could to repair the system as quickly as possible, I was still without light almost a week. According to my rental agreement, electricity is included in my monthly rental payment; I feel I should receive financial compensation for my recent suffering. I paid $700 in rental last month and I think I'm entitled to $200 in compensation. I was forced to use several portable battery powered lamps and flashlights to lighten over 5 days.
If you have further question, contact me at 888-423-1421 or email me at eallenhotmail.com.
Sincerely, Elaine Allen, Apartment 8-A

Dear Ms. Allen,
I am very sorry to hear that the electrical system in your apartment was out of commission for such an extended period of time. I fully understand the inconvenience this might have caused. I will be mailing you a reimbursement check in the amount that you requested. You have been a loyal tenant, and hope that will continue well into the future.
Sincerely, William Kresky, Owner, Greenery House Apartment`,
