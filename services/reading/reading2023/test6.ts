John Burwood [2:14 P.M.] I ordered mine online, and it was defective. I contacted the company's customer service department, and they sent me a new one that works just fine.
Laurie Jacobs [2:16 P.M.] I used to be a cook at a restaurant years ago, and we had a commercial-grade Canomatik can opener back then. I've been using the consumer version at home for nearly a decade. It opens cans safely and easily.

**Home Style Clothing Line Debuts**
MANILA (September 18)—Inspired by the handmade crafts of the Philippines, local designer Maritess Bautista has introduced Home Style, a clothing brand that features fabrics woven by area artisans using traditional practices. Bautista first learned basic weaving techniques from her mother and aunts in her youth and built on that knowledge as she studied at the Manila School of Fashion Design. [1], She then spent the next ten years working as a junior designer for Trendy Today. — [2] —. Finally, she returned to her hometown of San Jacinto to found Home Style.
Home Style's debut collection includes clothing and hair accessories that utilize the weaving techniques and designs that the area is known for. — [3] —. Ms. Bautista purchases all the textiles she uses from local craftspeople. Currently, Home Style merchandise is available only in select San Jacinto-area stores. — [4] —.
"I want to keep production local," said Ms. Bautista. "That's good for the artisans, and it's authentic. But I don't want the products to remain local. I want to bring our designs to the whole country—maybe even the world."`,

Welcome to the Clarrell Estate—Ballarton's premier centre for the arts! The exquisite grounds of the estate are situated on 60 hectares of hilly terrain featuring lush English gardens and an impressive manor house that was designed by noted architect Owen Barton. Ten years ago, the Clarrell Foundation decided to transform the estate into an arts centre. Initially, the foundation opened the manor house to the public, highlighting the Clarrell family art collection. In the last three years, a large, multiuse complex was built near the property entrance, complete with art studios and a theatre.
The Clarrell Estate's museum and gardens are open to the public free of charge. In addition, the theatre hosts public lectures as well as musical performances, and the studios showcase individual artists' curated works. For a complete schedule, a list of current artists, and information on admission fees for the theatre and studios, please visit the Events page.
Join the Clarrell Foundation to enjoy members-only special events and discounts on performances. Members also have the opportunity to reserve the gardens for private events. To become a member, contact Alicia Ji at aji@clarrellestate.com.au.`,

Hi Bridget,
I was wondering if you have heard from Sujata Reddy. She was enrolled in the painting class I teach on Tuesday and Thursday. She was only able to attend for the first week because another commitment came up. She said she asked someone in the Tucson Adult School office if she could drop the class, and she has requested a refund of the course tuition.
She said she hasn't received her refund yet. Did she contact you?
Best,

Hi Marybeth,
The name is familiar, but Ms. Reddy hasn't been in touch with me personally. Actually, I'm not the person she should contact. I just handle the scheduling as well as ordering supplies for the art classes.
I don't know who Ms. Reddy spoke to. According to our refund policy on the Tucson Adult School Web site, refunds are only granted if they are requested before the class begins or if there is a documented health reason for dropping the class. In the case of a health reason, the amount of the refund will be based on the number of classes completed.
Maybe Ms. Reddy can attend your second semester class instead of this semester's. That would be my suggestion.

**New Bakery Coming to Town**
OREVALE CITY (October 14)—A Cresson's Bakery is opening soon at the corner of Canton Avenue and Ridley Street. The location will be the national chain's first within the city limits. Like all Cresson's Bakery stores, it will operate seven days a week.
The only similar business in the vicinity is the Donut Station on the Kupperman University campus. Cresson's Bakery will offer breakfast sandwiches and fruit juices in addition to its signature coffee and baked goods. The company is following its revised business model to open compact facilities rather than sit-down eateries. This means the Orevale City location will offer takeout and drive-through service only.
The bakery will occupy Canton Avenue's smallest vacant lot. Approval for the project followed a public hearing where area residents voiced mixed opinions.
Gina Holton, who lives on Paxton Road, said she liked the idea of having a new bakery in her neighborhood but worries about traffic congestion on Ridley Street. As evidence, she presented pictures of heavy vehicle traffic there. Wofford Drive resident Steven Lu said he would enjoy having a convenient place to grab a quick snack.
Cresson's Bakery is slated to welcome its first customers in early March.

<hr class="my-6 border-slate-300 dark:border-slate-600 border-dashed" />

Dear Editor,
As a lifelong resident of Orevale City, I appreciate your coverage of Cresson's Bakery. Unfortunately, the October 14 article contained some inaccurate information. The photos that I shared during the public hearing captured images of traffic congestion in front of my house. Also, as a member of the city's Historic Preservation Committee, I was primarily concerned about the bakery's architecture. The initial building design for Cresson's Bakery was contemporary. I am pleased to report that the chain has agreed to modify the exterior so that it blends in better with the older structures surrounding it.
Sincerely,
Gina Holton`,

Dear Ms. Susilo,
As you may know, Raxconnect has been expanding its services in the Glasgow area over the past year. Our new fibre-optic cable lines offer faster and more reliable service and eliminate the need for aboveground wiring. In order for the system to work, we need to install Internet connection devices throughout the city. Phase 1 of our construction work involved City Centre. Phase 2 involved West End. Although Phase 2 took longer than expected, we were able to expedite Phase 3 and get back on schedule. Phase 4 is now ready to begin in your area.
Raxconnect would like to place a small Internet connection hub on your property at 29 Lefroy Street. Because of its central location on the street, your front yard would make an optimal connection point. Please call us at 0141 496 0001 by 10 April to let us know whether we may proceed. Thank you.

Brandy Mortimer, Utilities Adviser

The moves follow an announcement made earlier this year that Raxconnect had invested £350 million to expand its network. Local officials hope that the project brings new business and spending to their neighbourhoods.

The new products are expected to be in Australian stores by mid-November.
The company was founded 25 years ago by Albert and Annie Grundon, president and CEO, respectively. Earlier this year, they announced the opening of a South African division. South African retailers will get access to a number of Albert and Annie's products in mid-December.

**Ben's Nonprofit Burst—Resources for those who work in the nonprofit sector**
**Getting Grants**
Posted on August 18 by Ben Fineman
Grant writing is the art of completing applications for financial aid offered by government agencies, schools, corporations, or other entities. There is huge competition for grants and no room for mediocrity in grant writing. To improve your grant-writing skills, consider taking an online course taught by Kristina Gilliam of Meadow Park University. Her Writing Great Grants course is divided into four 90-minute interactive sessions. It is designed for people with some basic knowledge of grant writing. These Monday evening classes run from November 15 to December 6. For details and registration, visit www.kristinagilliam.ca/course. Use the promo code NPBURST at checkout to get 15 percent off the $350 tuition. This code expires on September 30. On October 1, only full-price registration will be available until the final registration day, November 1.

**Location:** Winnipeg
**Comment:** Relatively short compared to other writing courses I've taken, Writing Great Grants provided a decent overview. I was impressed to learn that the instructor helped companies get millions of dollars in grants during her career, and I'm glad to now have her as a resource if I ever get hired as a grant writer. Fortunately, I used Ben's Nonprofit Burst's promo code when I registered. Otherwise, I'd have considered the tuition too high. The Web site gave me the impression that Ms. Gilliam would include more specifics about the actual writing process than she did.

**Location:** Toronto
**Comment:** This was a great course overall. The instructor shared a wealth of valuable insights, including her experiences as the founder of Orden International. I never realized that grant-writing firms even existed! I might start one of my own if I ever leave my current grant-writing job. The course focused mainly on researching grant opportunities and analyzing samples of successful grant applications. When several of us asked for specific writing tips during the final session, Ms. Gilliam simply referred us to other resources. The course description on her Web site was a bit misleading in that regard.`,
