Subject: Performa lint roller (Model PL293)

Dear Ms. Ngxongo,
I am sorry to inform you that the Performa lint roller you selected is on back order because of a shortage of its ultra-strong adhesive. We expect a new shipment within three to four weeks. However, if you prefer not to wait, Home Things will be glad to ship the Extreme2 lint roller to you at no extra charge. The Extreme2 model includes a perforated sticky tape for ease of use and comes with two refills. Like the Performa model, it has a strong adhesive that effectively removes hair, fuzz, lint, and dust from most fabrics.
You can request this similar product to be shipped to you in place of the one you ordered, as long as you make the change to your order before the original item ships. Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Glen McCraine

Dear Bruce,
Beginning with the new fiscal year, a change in retirement benefits will be applied for all full-time employees here at Blanen Industries. They will no longer be given their matching retirement funds in the form of cash. Instead, their retirement funds will be provided in the form of company stock to be deposited in their retirement portfolios.
Our current retirement management firm, Proxave Futures, has been informed of this change in retirement benefits. The firm will manage the transition and will continue to provide customer support to Blanen Industries employees. Questions should be directed to Pierre Dehaene at Proxave Futures rather than our human resources department.
Please work with Yua Suzuki, head of human resources, to provide her with the information she should include in her all-staff communication about this important change in employee benefits. Our president notified me that he would like to receive all reports related to this transition. Also, please continue to send me daily financial reports.

Subject: Research results
Ms. Kucharski,
The following is a summary of what I have learned in my research about where to hold our next annual technology conference in June of next year.
In Rome, the best option I have found is Hotel al Ponte. The total cost for conference events there would be €31,500. — [1] —. Individual hotel rooms would cost €80 per night for participants. In the event that attendance is high, we could also house participants in the nearby Hotel Milvio at €120 per night. — [2] —.
I also looked into hotels in Genoa and Florence, but I could not find any that would be much cheaper in overall conference costs. — [3] —. More importantly, I am concerned that the greater cost of flights to those smaller cities could discourage some attendees. Rome, on the other hand, has affordable direct flights from most European cities. — [4] —. It will also be more affordable for our colleagues coming from Buenos Aires.
If you would like to pursue the Hotel al Ponte option, I will provide a detailed write-up of the anticipated costs and of the amenities offered by the hotel.
Best,

**Reviewed by:** Ari Kipp
**Date posted:** August 4
This is my second year subscribing to the *Central University Health Newsletter*, which I read cover to cover. I'm particularly impressed with the Ask an Expert column, and I always learn something new. This month, for instance, Dr. Stella Booth gives a surprising answer to the question of which pasta is most nutritious. I didn't know that bean-based pasta even existed, much less how much fiber it contains. I tried it and will never go back to regular pasta. My sole complaint is that the newsletter is only twelve pages long!`,

Thank you for sending your invoice for services rendered in the month of September. I want to commend you on your superb start as one of our independent freelance editors. Our clients had nothing but positive things to say about your work. As you know, we do not dictate how you structure your workday; instead, Brit-Revision (BRV) guidelines require simply that deadlines be met and that work quality be maintained. You have done both admirably.
Also, we will pay you for an additional 30 minutes of work that you did for Mr. Kent. He reported that you did consulting work for him over the phone on a short oral presentation that he created. As for the work that you did for our long-standing corporate client Lydia Quinn, you will see on your receipt that we have paid you at a higher hourly rate.
I have initiated the transfer of £750 into your Stashcash account. The funds should appear in your account by tomorrow morning.
Sincerely,
Claudio Aguilar, Accounts Payable, Brit-Revision Editing Services`,

Subject: Notes on rough cut of video

Dear Mr. Herman,
Thank you for sending the rough version of the informational video for our new Fluorolook Imager. I think that the video looks great so far. It clearly demonstrates why the Fluorolook is the best medical imaging device available. I have just a few notes before you proceed to create the final version.
• At 20 seconds: Could you insert a short timeline of the history of The Hospital Equipment Company? I have attached the relevant information to this e-mail.
• At 1 minute: I had a hard time seeing the details of the control panel in this scene. Could you please replace it with a close-up shot?
• At 2 minutes: The sequence in which the medical technician positions the patient and adjusts the machine moves too quickly. Can this be slowed down?
I look forward to seeing the final version on September 23. As always, thank you and your colleagues at Video Genie Productions for the excellent work.
Sincerely,
Ms. Sapna Mathai, Project Manager, The Hospital Equipment Company

Re: Good work!
Congratulations on the successful launch of the Fluorolook Imager! The Hospital Equipment Company has made its first sale—to a hospital in Clear Lake. And MDP Delivery has informed us that the two devices have been delivered.
I would especially like to commend Ms. Mathai. She was instrumental in getting us to this point. The administrator of the hospital that made the purchase, Mr. Fabrice Lamontagne, credited his decision to the informational video. He remarked that the video effectively demonstrated why the Fluorolook Imager was the right device for his medical institution.`,

Dear Mr. Nadal:
We appreciate your fulfilling our recent order of extra-virgin olive oil so quickly. Unfortunately, there is a small issue with the shipment, and we need your assistance. While nothing was damaged or missing, the 3-litre bulk size containers were delivered in error.
We would like to arrange to send these products back. Please inform us how to proceed.

Dear Ms. Seong,
I apologise for the error in order number SK6224. We have determined that your order was accidentally combined with another in our electronic database. Unfortunately, we are unable to restock any items that have left our warehouse. Therefore, you may keep the additional olive oil and sell it in your stores. Also, you will receive a refund for the extra charge within the next five to ten business days because of our mistake.
We are currently celebrating peak olive season by offering 10 percent off of your next order. Also, during our Olive Harvest Festival in December, every shipment includes samples of our company's classic olive oil that we encourage you to give to your shoppers with our compliments.
We hope to continue providing Best Products Supermarket with the finest olive oils.
Sincerely yours,
Pablo Nadal, Export Division Manager, Reina Olive Oil Company`,
