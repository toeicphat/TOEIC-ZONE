Amal Taylor, the product manager, opened the meeting. She reported that our new line of herbal teas will be on local store shelves and in restaurants starting September 25. The initial launch includes three flavors: peppermint, lemon ginger, and hibiscus flower. More varieties are expected to be added next year.
Next, Miguel Luna shared his prototypes of the tea boxes and discussed the sustainability of the materials used to produce them. The colorful designs received positive feedback from meeting attendees.
After that, Jennifer Lin provided a brief overview of the marketing budget for the product launch. Funds are currently limited to one advertising campaign. For more detailed information about the marketing budget, contact Ms. Lin directly.
Finally, Vladimir Ikram led a discussion about advertising options. Radio advertisements have been successful in the past and are cheaper than television. Digital advertisements were also considered. The final decision was to start with print advertisements in The Southtown Times.

**Review of Central Art Museum**
Reviewer: Mary Walsh
Stars: ★★★★★
I recommend the Central Art Museum to anyone interested in not only art but history as well. I've made two trips to the museum recently. My first trip was with my school's photography club. We only saw the special exhibit featuring photography, but I left wanting to see the rest of the museum. I returned a few days later and had the chance to walk through the entire museum. Each exhibit was different but full of interesting pieces. Be sure to stop at the interactive room near the gift shop for a hands-on experience. During my first trip, the room had cameras with fun backgrounds. Visitors took pictures of themselves, and for a small fee, I got a printout of myself as if I were holding a flag on the moon! Like the special exhibits, the activities at the interactive room change every month, so you will always find something new and interesting to do.`,

**Alexandria's Restaurant Showcase**
June 5—Alexandria's Restaurant Showcase is back! From July 8 to July 25, participating restaurants in the Alexandria area will offer set menus at discounted prices. As in past years, restaurants can offer a two-course lunch menu for $15, a two-course dinner menu for $20, or a three-course dinner menu for $30. Both customers and restaurant owners love the showcase. Food enthusiasts try new options at a lower cost, and restaurants report it's the time of year when dining areas are at their fullest.
Alexandria had its first restaurant showcase 15 years ago. It was modeled on a similar showcase in the beach town of Willmar. Originally, only eight restaurants participated. Since then, the showcase has grown, adding more restaurants and extending the number of days each year. This year, there will be 40 participating restaurants—about 70 percent of all the restaurants in Alexandria. Those looking to book a table should act fast. Some restaurants require reservations, and the most popular places book up quickly. To see the list of participating restaurants and make a reservation, visit www.alexandriarestaurants.com/showcase.

To Whom It May Concern,
Rollervy University is looking for someone to coordinate activities, promote student engagement, and provide professional customer service. I did all three during my tenure as the Campus Recreation Manager at Parvaton College.
At Parvaton, I increased participation in student activities by 37 percent. I also created a running club and planned excursions off campus. I placed a great emphasis on volunteering, including a project to pair college tutors with local high school students who needed help with classwork.
Overall, I believe I'm an excellent fit for the available position. I am punctual, detail oriented, and committed to increasing students' connection to their academic institution. I look forward to hearing back about a potential interview.

**To:** Celeste O'Brien
**From:** Monica Cheung
**Date:** October 15
**Subject:** Mobile phone reimbursement policy
Dear Ms. O'Brien,
As the Assistant Director of Accounting, I am writing about the policy regarding mobile phone expenses. Many Ferd Data Services employees use their personal mobile phones for business calls. To get reimbursed, they must submit a form every month. Ferd then pays up to 30 percent of the phone bill. My department confirms each employee's calculations and then schedules payments that vary every month.
Some companies have moved to a flat-rate model, whereby all employees who qualify receive a fixed amount each month (e.g., $20). No staff time is required for monthly processing; the allowance is automatically included in each paycheck.
I hope that, as head of Human Resources, you will consider adopting a policy like this.
Sincerely,
Monica Cheung
