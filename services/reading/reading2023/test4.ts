**Your upgraded Impala card is in the mail!**
At Impala Credit Union, your safety and convenience are paramount. That is why we are introducing contactless technology for all our member credit and debit cards. With this new development, you will no longer have to swipe or insert your card in a chip reader at checkout. In fact, you will not even need to remove your card from a physical wallet; simply hold it near a point of sale for it to be read!
There are a few important things to keep in mind. First, your current card will be deactivated on October 31. You may continue to use it until that time.
Second, the upgraded card may arrive before your current one expires. Once you activate the new card, the old one will automatically be deactivated and no longer be valid for use. You will need to manually activate your new card by following the instructions on the attached sticker.
Third, your contactless technology card will have a new card number, expiration date, and security number. When activating, you will be prompted to choose a PIN (personal identification number). The PIN from your current card will not automatically transfer over. Be sure to update your card on file for all preferred online retailers and app subscriptions to ensure continued access.
We hope that you enjoy your new card. For any questions regarding your contactless technology Impala card, feel free to contact customer service at 1-610-555-0168.`,

**Cassie Alswith (9:25 A.M.)** Would it be okay if I submit the weekly progress report on Monday instead of Friday? That way I'll have a little more time to prepare for the presentation.

Dear Ms. Tartal,
I am writing to notify you of some upcoming changes regarding your retirement investment account at Westmouth Financial. — [1] —. Firstly, as you may already know, your primary financial services advisor, Felix Reardon, is retiring next month. — [2] —. I have over fifteen years of experience working in personal finance and have worked at Westmouth Financial for three of those years, helping over 25 clients meet their retirement goals through savvy financial planning. I am excited to help you continue this journey.
Secondly, I would like to schedule a time to meet or talk with you about your current portfolio. — [3] —. We could meet in person or just have a simple phone or video chat, but it would be good for us to touch base to plan your investment strategy for the next ten years as you are nearing your retirement. Along those lines, I specifically wanted to see if you were interested in shifting some of your funds into more stable assets like bonds and annuities. — [4] —. I usually recommend shifting into these safer options as you get closer to retirement. Please feel free to call me or send an e-mail so we can arrange a time to talk. Thanks, and I look forward to speaking more.
Sincerely,
Rita Hidayat, Account Manager`,

**New Home for Theatre Group**
AUCKLAND (11 July)—The south end of Darby Street is dominated by the imposing Victorian building that formerly held the main branch of Pacific Trade Bank. That building is now the home of the Cornata Theatre Company. After a grand-opening ceremony on Tuesday, tours of the new theatre were given to attendees.
The debut show is Relax, a comedy by Mi-Sun Yeo about a popular tourist site. Performances are scheduled to begin on Saturday, 16 July, and run until the end of the month.
According to Noah Larkins, the artistic director of the Cornata Theatre Company, "talk-backs" will immediately follow every performance. Talk-backs allow the director and cast members to share their thoughts about the play, and audience members can ask them questions. "We want to be part of the artistic communities in both Auckland and the larger community around us," said Mr. Larkins.
The building houses a main stage theatre that seats approximately 325 people and a smaller studio theatre upstairs. The company will also offer acting classes for children and adults. For more information or to buy tickets, visit the company's Web page at www.cornatatheatre.nz.

There did seem to be a problem with the concession stand. There was a long line for food and drinks, and it did not move very quickly.`,

Mr. Melville,
I just received the job offer from Ventana Bank that we discussed on Monday. They are meeting my salary request and offering me money for relocating too.
This has been my goal ever since you hired me as a teller, right out of college. But now that I have been offered my dream job, I am having doubts. The new location seems so far away. I would rarely get to see my parents and my siblings.
I would welcome your help in this matter. Could we get together in the next few days for lunch or coffee? As you know, I have always valued your input, and I have missed our lunchtime conversations since you retired.

When I was recently in Mexico, I purchased a block of your fine cocoa. It was the best I ever had! I did some research on your products, and I was very impressed with your process. I especially appreciate that your workers take care to remove the shells from the beans by hand.
I would like to purchase some more to make my own chocolates at home. Please send me information and pricing. I would prefer to purchase a one-pound block of pure, unsweetened Yucatan cocoa. I will be sweetening the candy myself, so I am not looking for sweetened cocoa.
Thank you.

First, customers had issues getting adequate customer service—this was due to slow e-mail response times, especially when making changes to orders. Medallion recommends investing in a chat window for the Web site and training customer representatives to use it. Customers enjoyed the Web site, and the chat feature would allow customers to get immediate service.
One general comment stood out regarding product options. Customers appreciated the wide variety of low-pile carpets with short fibers. They appreciated their high durability for areas where people frequently walk. However, they were also interested in thicker shag rugs for lounge areas like living rooms.
