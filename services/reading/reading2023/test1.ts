LONDON (2 February)—On Thursday, Tillford Press announced the launch of its new imprint, Tillford Exalt.

Subject: Project Coordinator Position
Attachment: résumé_m.mcfarland.pdf

Dear Mr. Abboud,
My friend Josiah Wilkins told me that you are seeking a project coordinator for your company. I have a degree in business administration and am attaching my résumé as I think I am an excellent fit for your needs. As you will see, I have experience using several cloud-based project-management programs. Furthermore, my organizational skills enable me to coordinate multiple activities simultaneously, and I can convey expectations clearly to team members involved in each phase of a project.

My current role as project coordinator for an international engineering firm, where I have worked for the past five years, has also afforded me ample experience managing teams, schedules, and budgets. While I enjoy the kind of work I do, it has become clear to me that I need motivation from a strong mission. The goal of your company to create sustainable housing projects is something that I strongly support and would be delighted to work on.

Through my work and volunteer activities, I have spent many months abroad in various countries throughout Asia and the Middle East. This seems particularly relevant to mention, as I am comfortable leading geographically and culturally diverse teams.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
Kind regards,
Maria McFarland`,

**Gorman Unveils Newest Smartphone Model**
LONDON (20 April)—Gorman Mobile unveiled its newest smartphone to an eager reception at the annual Technobrit Conference. The Pro Phone 4, which includes 512 GB of storage, a 7-inch screen display, and an optional stylus pen, will hit the shelves on 11 June. Unlike its predecessor—the Pro Phone 3—it features a larger screen, an ultrawide camera lens, and 8K-resolution filming capability.
— [1] —. The £999 starting price is £100 more than that of the previous model. Add-ons, such as the stylus pen, protective case, and wireless headphones, cost an additional £39, £59, and £79, respectively.
Gorman Product Manager Ian Hill doesn't believe the price increase will dissuade customers. — [2] —.
"The Pro Phone 4 is a game changer in terms of its picture quality and sleek design," said Hill. "Improvements were based on direct customer feedback, which cited the poor camera functionality as the biggest drawback of prior models. Our clients spoke, and we listened and adapted accordingly." — [3] —.
One similarity that the Pro Phone 4 has with previous models is the charger. Going against the trend of competing wireless companies, Gorman is instead focusing on convenience.
"We want to afford our customers the ability to reuse elements of the other Gorman devices they've already purchased," said Hill. "Why add to the overload of cables already in circulation?" — [4] —.`,

Subject: Tech support request 7549

Hello, Ms. Xi,
This is in reference to your work order 7549 related to the new phone system. I am happy to help you with that. I understand that you do not feel that a high degree of security is needed for your voice-mail settings, but the new system does require you to have a password to retrieve your voice mail. However, company policy allows me to change the settings for employees who do not work with confidential material. I can update the security settings so that you do not have to reset the password on a regular basis.

I want to make sure that you understand the risk involved with a lower level of security. Anyone who gains access to your voice-mail account can do more than simply listen to your messages. They would be able to delete messages, change your greeting, or change your password so that you would lose access to your own voice mail (at least until someone here at IT could override the password change). If you still feel comfortable with that level of risk, let me know, and I will change the settings so that your password never expires.

To: Linda Hanshu
From: Cliff Merson
Subject: Lighting Issue
Date: September 4, 10:12 A.M.

Hi, Ms. Hanshu:
I want to check on the issue we discussed about lighting in the latest chapter of Titan Adventure. In past versions of the game, getting the reflections and lighting in green and blue areas correct has been a particular challenge, and it was a problem that kept arising. As the new release, Neptune's Voyage, is primarily an underwater adventure, addressing this problem is crucial. You said you would take charge of this, and I hope to hear that you have found a solution to the problem. The team was hoping to have one last rendering of the lighting for the game by October 10 for a preliminary run-through. Will the final version of the lighting be ready by then?
All other aspects of the game are on schedule. Please send me an update about the lighting at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
Cliff Merson
Project Manager, Rimerko Games

**Review of Titan Adventure: Neptune's Voyage**
By Leo Weber, April 1

This new installment of Titan Adventure will surprise and delight both new players and old aficionados long familiar with the series. Though open-world formats have been widespread in recent years, Neptune's Voyage brings something new to the format. By stripping down instructional guides, the game gives users the opportunity to discover new areas and devices. In Neptune's Voyage, you wake up as Thetis, a dolphin that is tasked with rescuing Neptune from an underwater cave. Users then climb, run, ride, sail, and fly through the world of the game, encountering new towns, ruins, and other creatures along the way. Some of these creatures will be familiar to longtime fans, but there is plenty of novelty as well. This newest version also corrects the green and blue image rendering that was sometimes a problem in earlier installments of Titan Adventure.
Neptune's Voyage launches May 5 on Rimerko Clutch and FS5. It is available in English, Korean, Japanese, French, and Spanish.`,

Subject: My new radio station!
Date: October 22

To the folks at Wonder Ridge Radio:
As I was driving last week, I got tired of listening to sports talk and turned the dial. Suddenly, my car was filled with a song that I hadn't heard in many years. It was traditional music from France, where my grandmother was born. She used to play that song when I was a child. I never expected to hear it on the radio here in Wonder Ridge. Thanks for this experience and for all your great programs.
Your new fan,
Pierre Fabre

Dear Ms. Park,
Thank you for confirming that my documents are available. I would like to pick them up in person as soon as possible. Do you have any appointments available this week?
I have a question about the fee. Apparently, I am being charged $300 for my documents. I do not understand why the fee is so high, and there was no explanation included in your e-mail. I have requested records several times in the past in my role with RJ Environmental Engineering and have never paid such a high fee. In this case, I am only requesting two maps of the city's underground pipelines, which will inform our firm's current work advising the city on wastewater management.
Please clarify the fee for me, and let me know if I can pick up my documents this week. Thank you.
Best regards,
Keith Brandenberg

**Famous Actor, First Book**
LONDON (25 February)—Fans of Simon Eklund will be delighted with his autobiography, The Theatre Lights Dimmed, the first book he has written in his storied career as an actor. It provides wonderful insight into his career, starting with his first roles in cinema in his native Sweden, moving into his work in France and Italy, and finishing with his recent theatre work in the U.K.
In his book, Mr. Eklund dedicates a fair amount of text to discussing his mentor, Charles Gunnarsson, who helped him develop his skills early on in Stockholm. He also describes the difficulty of transitioning into different types of roles, especially from comedic to dramatic acting. He includes several funny anecdotes about his first attempts at acting onstage here in London. He describes them as disastrous, but anyone who saw his recent performance in Life and Games would say just the opposite.
Mr. Eklund has long been a captivating actor on stage and screen, and now he is a thoroughly engaging author.

Dear Edith,
Thank you for agreeing to arrange an interview with Mr. Eklund for me. I think this will be a great follow-up to my recent piece.
In a helpful coincidence, I will be visiting his home country next month to address a journalists' convention. I am the featured speaker and will discuss the benefits of diversity in journalism. I'm sure we can set up something with Mr. Eklund just before or after my speech.

Best,
