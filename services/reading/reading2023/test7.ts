Dear Parsons Road Businesses:
Beginning in March, Parsons Road will be widened between Memorial Boulevard and Hallam Road. The project will add a center turn lane, bicycle paths, pedestrian paths, and streetlights. In addition, a side gutter will be added to improve water flow.
The Parsons Road project ties into work completed between Hallam Road and Ingraham Avenue earlier this year. This work will improve access to your businesses and increase pedestrian safety on Parsons Road, which can be quite busy. The roadwork is expected to take three months to complete.

Some park visitors have been intentionally stacking piles of rocks as an art form or for amusement. Please refrain from doing this on park grounds, as these unofficial rock stacks can disrupt sensitive habitats and affect the area's natural beauty.
New rock piles can also endanger hikers who traditionally rely on stacked rock markers as navigational tools. Park officials are the only ones who should be stacking rocks, and they do so strategically on trails where the path may be unclear. If you see rocks that have been stacked, please leave them alone, and do not create confusion by making your own stack.`,

**Orinti Explains Web Site Updates**
SAN DIEGO (May 2)—Orinti, Inc., one of North America's largest purveyors of tea, recently added a page to its Web site, listing the sources of all the tea leaves that end up in its final products. The page was created in response to recent public scrutiny over whether the company is justified in claiming that its tea is pesticide-free.
"The rumors being circulated do not reflect reality," Orinti CEO Giovanni Shaw said in a public statement issued on Tuesday. "We procure tea leaves only from producers who meet our strict quality standards. We never settle for anything less."
According to Mr. Shaw, the company also utilizes software that tracks the producer, the processing date, and other pertinent data for each batch of tea leaves. "This level of detail is not displayed on our packaging for the simple reason that we do not have the space for it," said Mr. Shaw. "As we are committed to transparency, this information can be viewed on our Web site."
The popular blog foodnews.org was the first to call into question Orinti's assertion that its tea leaves are grown without the use of pesticides. The issue has since attracted national attention.`,

**In the Kitchen**
*Reviewed by Peter Gottlieb*
Qi Chien understands how restaurants work. Her new book, In the Kitchen: How to Thrive in the Restaurant Business, expertly advises restaurant managers on handling challenges in the industry, from creating reasonable schedules for chefs to appeasing picky diners. Throughout the book, Chien offers concise, practical suggestions with easy-to-understand concepts. Overall, the book offers a colorful snapshot of the various tasks involved in the day-to-day operations of a restaurant.
Chien's book is unique among other industry guides in that she interviewed restaurant owners, managers, and customers as part of her research. She even spoke to journalists who write restaurant reviews to get a good sense of what they most prize in a dining experience. My only criticism is that the book should have also included the perspective of chefs, especially since their role is crucial to a restaurant's success. This caveat aside, In the Kitchen is an insightful and instructive read.

To the Editor:
I was delighted to read Peter Gottlieb's review of my latest book, In the Kitchen, in your newspaper. I have appreciated his thoughtful comments about my works over the years, even if they are sometimes negative. In this case, I was especially glad that he liked the chapter about restaurant reviewers, since initially I had been reluctant to interview journalists for the book. It is true that I could have included a greater variety of insights, but unfortunately the people whose views he most wanted to hear were just too busy to speak with me before the publishing deadline. Perhaps this is something I can address in an updated edition of the book.

Hello, Harriet,
I am delighted you are available for this latest project; we were very pleased with your previous work. Here are some general instructions to start.
On the back wall, hang the Vint Apparel neon sign high enough to be seen over other furniture in the store. The sign has already shipped and should be delivered next Monday.
The rectangular light fixtures will also arrive on Monday. There should be four—two for each of the side walls. The racks and shelving to display clothing are already there. Please place the three circular racks in the center of the store and put the two shelving units along the left side as you enter the store. Finally, place the cashier station to the right as you enter the store.
I have attached a drawing of the layout that includes more detail.
Regards,
Karl Vinton, Owner

Subject: Deonardo pilot testing
Thank you for agreeing to work with the team at Cybernetic Robotics as they tested their new robot, Deonardo, in our hospital. As you know, Deonardo was developed to allow you, our nursing staff, more time to focus on patients. This is exciting work.
It has been a month, and Cybernetic Robotics would like to hear about your experiences with Deonardo. Please use the following link to complete an online survey. The team especially wants to know about your experiences with Deonardo during the state reviewers' inspection on January 28. At the end of the survey, you may leave any additional comments you have about the robot.

Deonardo is easy to work with. I like that I don't have to tell Deonardo directly what to do. When I update patient information in our system, Deonardo's tasks are updated as well. I have been better able to concentrate on my patients because I know Deonardo takes care of little things that used to take up so much of my time.
Deonardo was particularly helpful during a recent state review because it delivered patients' medications for all the nurses so that we didn't have to, and we were able to focus on patient care. I believe Deonardo helped us receive positive comments from the inspectors.
I do wish Deonardo could respond to voice commands. And occasionally, its wheels squeak as it moves around. But patients like watching it work, and everyone wants to take pictures with it. I wonder if you could get Deonardo to stand still for pictures?

Subject: Deonardo in-house pilot
Thank you all for your help with Deonardo, our nursing robot. I'm glad that our staff has been able to take part in such groundbreaking work.
Those of you who work directly with Deonardo can expect it to behave a bit differently in the coming week. It will be programmed to perform some new tasks. Previously, it waited at the nurse's station between tasks. Now, it will spend some of this time interacting with patients who may want to pose for pictures with it. When Deonardo is in this socializing mode, the eyes on its LED face will be heart-shaped instead of the round eyes that indicate that it is in work mode.
Finally, the hospital will be purchasing two additional robots in the next few months to work in other areas of the hospital. I appreciate your willingness to work with this new technology. We look forward to learning how robots can further improve employee and patient experiences.
Sincerely,
Gretchen Robertson, Director, Everlast Hospital`,

Subject: R&D Director Search
Date: 24 July
Dear Management Team Members,
On behalf of the hiring committee, I am pleased to report that the search for a new research and development director is nearing completion.
Given the key selection criteria the suitable candidate must meet—a demonstrated ability to improve product offerings, a keen awareness of consumers' tastes, and in-depth knowledge of nutritional science we have narrowed the applicant pool to Alex Mooring and Inez Fuentes. While either makes for an excellent choice, I believe that Ms. Fuentes is better suited to the role. Though somewhat less experienced than Mr. Mooring, she has innovative ideas that are in line with our company's needs.
Attached are the résumés and references of the two candidates. The dates, times, and location of their final interviews will be forthcoming in another e-mail when that information is finalized. We look forward to your participation in these meetings as well as your final hiring decision.
Sincerely,
Supriya Chakravarty, Chair, Hiring Committee

**Upcoming Events at Primidian Food Industries**
On 7 October at 10 A.M., Ms. Inez Fuentes, director of research and development at Primidian Food Industries (PFI), will facilitate a workshop titled Food Innovation for the Future. Among other things, she will explain why PFI recently reformulated its pasta products and demonstrate how they can be prepared in novel, tasty ways.
Ms. Fuentes is a certified nutritionist with a degree in food science from Mexico City's Academy of Science and Technology. Upon graduation, she accepted a two-year internship at Italy's prestigious Rome Institute of Culinary Arts. Before joining PFI's executive team, she served for five years as lead product development manager at Zesty Meals, based in Montreal, Canada.
Register for this free event at www.pfi.co.uk/events/register, specifying whether you will attend online or in person at our corporate headquarters in Birmingham.

**Your Message:**
I thoroughly enjoyed the Food Innovation for the Future workshop led by Ms. Fuentes on 28 October. I almost missed it, though. Apparently, when details about the workshop were updated, including that it would be an online-only event, my registration—and, I learned, that of some other participants—was not transferred over. Luckily, a staffer charged with online registration was able to quickly reregister me. PFI may want to analyse its electronic registration system and make improvements where necessary so that this problem does not reoccur.
