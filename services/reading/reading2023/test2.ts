**History**
Welcome to the historic H. G. Walsh Building and North Riverview Restaurant! Constructed by H. G. Walsh in 1897, the building served as Astoria's post office until 1942. It has subsequently been a general store, a boutique, and a family-run restaurant serving up fresh seafood. Over the past century, the building's second floor has been used for private parties, such as birthdays and weddings.
Facing a potential demolition in the late 1970s, the building was purchased by its current owners, Henry and Juana Thomason, in 1981. Subsequent investment and extensive renovation helped save the H. G. Walsh Building, and in 1996 it gained status on the National Register of Historic Places. With its stunning views of the Columbia River and an extensive seasonal menu, the H. G. Walsh Building has become a prime destination for visitors to Oregon's Pacific coast.

**Headquarters Teams Help Out in Stores**
Hannen has operated one of the largest chains of department stores in the Southwest since 1962. The In-Store Project, launched on February 7, is a new initiative from the Hannen Department Store corporate operations team. Following recommendations from employees at various levels, the initiative was developed to allow company headquarters to better understand the day-to-day operations at the individual store level.
The In-Store Project places employees from the corporate headquarters in stores, where they are paired with store employees to work typical shifts. This allows both types of Hannen employees to ask questions and learn about one another's work. So far, the initiative has led to a greater understanding among store employees of the decisions made at the corporate level and a greater understanding among headquarters employees on how corporate plans are implemented.
Hannen plans to complete store visits within the next two months and conduct repeat visits annually.`,

**KARLINGA BEACH (December 4)**—More resources need to be allocated to promote cultural tourism to the region, officials from the Karlinga Beach Tourism Department (KBTD) concluded at a planning meeting held yesterday. The department also drafted a new marketing campaign, titled "Connect with Karlinga Beach," that will highlight the region's rich history and culture. "Everyone agreed that, moving forward, we should focus less on advertising traditional beach activities and more on new eco-friendly tourist activities," said Tourism Director Arnold Bhatt.
During the meeting, Mr. Bhatt gave a presentation in which he analyzed the results from an online questionnaire designed by students from the region's university. Respondents included both local residents and tourists. In one key result, more than 80 percent of all respondents agreed that there should be more emphasis on promoting eco-friendly tourism. In another finding, more than 75 percent of surveyed tourists indicated they would like to see a wider selection of locally sourced, organic food options.
"For me, the tourists' response was unexpected," said Mr. Bhatt. "But, looking at the full picture, it makes sense, as there are many family farms on the land near the beach."
The insights from the survey are welcome news for Kathy Li, who operates the KLP Organic Farm. Its grocery store, located on the farm property, is stocked year-round with fresh, seasonal, organically grown produce. In the future, if tourist visits increase, Ms. Li plans to offer prepared foods and beverages.`,

**New Addition to Shadeside Plaza**
BIRCH CITY (November 12)—Design Glory, a jewelry business operated by lifelong Birch City resident Tamara Banda, has set up a brick-and-mortar store in the city's Shadeside Plaza shopping area. — [1] —. Ms. Banda said the shop, which opened on November 9, features her entire line of handmade jewelry along with a selection of beautiful natural crystals that can become the centerpiece of any room.
Ms. Banda emphasizes that she sets her jewelry brand apart from others by offering handmade designs at price points that won't break a budget. To keep her overhead costs in check, she says she sources materials creatively from a variety of local metal suppliers. — [2] —. Although managing the store, which is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., will occupy much of her time, Ms. Banda said she still intends to operate booths at regional arts festivals. — [3] —. She will also continue to serve on the planning committee for the annual art show at Central Arts University, where she learned her jewelry-making techniques.
The idea of opening a physical store came to Ms. Banda when a friend, Brad Machado, told her of his positive experience in operating his retail bookshop on the opposite side of Shadeside Plaza from where Design Glory is now. — [4] —. The shopping area, he said, benefits from the heavy foot traffic nearby.`,

Dear Ms. Powell,
I was pleased to read your letter offering me the position of legal assistant. However, after much consideration, I have decided that now is not the best time to leave Wilson Law. I did not realize how deeply I am invested in working on my projects here until I was faced with the possibility of leaving the company. While I was thrilled by the idea of working for an illustrious law firm that has won so many high-profile environmental cases, now is not the time for me to make a change.
It was a pleasure meeting you and your colleagues, and I hope we cross paths in the future.
Kind regards,

**MEMO**
To: Kildare Recreation Centre Staff
From: Madeline Byrne
Date: 11 April
Subject: Daily Passes
As discussed in April's staff meeting, we are considering raising the cost of daily passes from €5 to €9. The exact increase will be decided in our May meeting. This change is expected to bring in an extra €5,000 over the next year, which we will use toward the cost of replacing our outdoor running track. With the increased revenue from the fee change, we will be close to the €7,000 needed for the improvement.
I realize that the outdoor running season is short, and I know that in our meeting, some staff members wanted to consider other uses for the money. The possibilities of using the funds for a remodeled reception area, a new floor for the dance studio, or more flat-screen televisions throughout the centre were raised. However, the board of directors thought it would be wiser to focus on the improvement most frequently requested by our members. The upgrades suggested by the staff fall into the €1,000-€2,000 range, and we hope to be able to consider them in the coming years.

**NOTICE**
Kildare Recreation Centre Visitors
Effective 1 June, the cost of a daily pass for nonmembers will be €8. This modest increase will allow us to provide visitors with a much better outdoor running track. The cost of monthly and annual memberships has not changed. Please visit the registration office during regular business hours to discuss membership-related issues.`,

My trial version of the Carina Solutions hotel management software expires tomorrow, and I have to decide whether to purchase the Premier version or search for something better. I have two main concerns.
1. The reservations module does not allow you to keep information about repeat guests on file. This forces staff to reenter repeat customers' information manually, which wastes time.
2. The software offers full functionality only when accessed on a desktop computer, which is unfortunate because I do almost everything on my mobile phone. The interface should be the same no matter what device you use.
