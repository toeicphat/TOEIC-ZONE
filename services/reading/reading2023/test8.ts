**Rapido Airline Coming Soon to Encino Pass**
ENCINO PASS (March 11)—Encino Pass Airport officials have announced that Rapido Airline will begin offering flights in and out of Encino Pass this summer. Rapido joins Gamma Air and Southern Skylines in serving the regional airport.
As the city of Encino Pass has grown in recent years, Encino Pass Airport has seen increased air traffic, despite being the smallest airport in the state. With flights to Encino Pass regularly booked to capacity, travelers often had to use other regional airports. The Encino Pass Airport and the city council have both been working to attract more airlines to the area to better accommodate the increase in the number of travelers.
"Rapido Airline was our top choice as an expansion airline," said Encino Pass Mayor Chris Donovan. "It is known for offering low fares, maintaining on-time schedules, and surpassing safety inspections. We're pleased that it has decided to join us here in Encino Pass. This addition will expand options and make air travel more convenient for residents and visitors alike."
The city and airport are also in talks to provide shuttle bus service between the airport and surrounding parking facilities, refurbish the rental car booths, and add another terminal to the airport. The negotiations are part of the city's long-term plan to increase tourism in the area.
Rapido Airline's flights between Encino Pass and Summerset begin on July 9, with more routes to be added later in the month.`,

**Yum and Walk Food Tours Adding a New Destination**
COLLEGE STATION (May 15)—On June 2, Yum and Walk Food Tours will add College Station to its statewide list of culinary destinations.
"College Station has been overlooked as a culinary destination for too long," said tour-company owner Ed Lopez. A former chef, Lopez also once worked as a journalist and wrote about cuisine for the Texas Beacon.
Yum and Walk Food Tours offers outings in nine other cities in Texas and brings visitors to restaurants, bakeries, and specialty stores to sample both sweet and savory treats. Visitors walk through the city with an experienced guide, who also shares information about each neighborhood's history. Mr. Lopez himself will serve as the tour guide in College Station, his home before working in San Antonio and then returning to the area.
"From the beginning, my goal has been to help people discover great food," said Mr. Lopez.
The local itinerary includes five stops in a three-hour time span—Giuseppina's Trattoria, Yucatan Plate, Kerala Kebabs, Spice Rub Stop, and Delicious Doughnuts. Customers can schedule private tours if they have any specific dietary preferences or requirements.
Local officials are excited about the tour company's move into the area. "We're thrilled to have Yum and Walk Food Tours add us to their list of destinations," said College Station Mayor Maria Garcia. "Their presence is sure to have a positive impact on our area's dining establishments."
Tickets are $50 each. The ten-week touring season begins on July 2 and lasts until September 3. Tours take place on Sundays from 1 P.M. to 4 P.M.`,

Dear Customer Service Representative:
In October my company ordered 60 paperback copies of the Food Safety Course Book for our employees so they could study for their mandatory food safety certification. I just learned from one of our managers that you offer this course book in languages other than English. May I send back twenty of the English language versions and get ten Polish and ten Portuguese books instead? Some of our new employees said they would really appreciate being able to read the crucial information in their first language.
The books I wish to return are still in their original packaging. I can have them boxed and shipped quickly, but I will wait for your acknowledgement and instructions regarding paperwork.

Sincerely,
Ella Feehan, Food Services Director, Rossfield Hotels Ltd.

**Review: Pizza in Bobbingworth**
**Submitted by: Gerard Landis**
★★★★☆
There is a new pizza restaurant in town called Maple Pizza House. Not to my surprise, it offers a number of signature pizzas with maple flavoring, including dessert pizzas. While I personally did not like the maple-flavored pizza at all, the rest of my party enjoyed a large maple-ham pizza as a main course. The others in my group also devoured the maple-walnut dessert pizza, which, to me, tasted like an overly sweet, sticky pie.
Fortunately for me, the menu includes some pizzas that do not have maple flavoring. I ordered a traditional cheese pizza. It was served piping hot and was delicious. Because there were tasty menu options that pleased everyone, I rate the Maple Pizza House 4 stars out of 5, and I would recommend visiting.

**RHC Continues to Impress**
**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**
**Contact:** Dora Su, +65 0555 1294
SINGAPORE (3 August)—In operation for five years, Rayder Holdings Corporation (RHC) is announcing the completion of its sixth renovation project, Bay Commons. The company, founded by real estate agents Rayna Wong and Derrick Lim, specializes in converting industrial buildings into apartment complexes.
"Turning commercial buildings into residential spaces has its challenges," Ms. Wong said. "However, we are committed to repurposing buildings instead of constructing new ones."
This commitment was recently cited in a speech by Yamina Badawi, Singapore's minister of Housing and Urban Development, who applauded RHC's contribution to the nation's housing supply.
RHC completed its first conversion project four years ago—the Kallang Overlook apartment complex. Since then, RHC has completed five more projects: Asten Estates, Tampines Tower, Lakeside Manor, Yishun Terrace, and now Bay Commons.
"Bay Commons represents a departure from our previous projects," Ms. Wong noted. "This housing complex is designed primarily for students at the nearby Changi Technological Institute."
Units at Bay Commons are now available for rent or purchase, she added.

Hello, Mr. Goh. A fellow resident found your wallet on the cafeteria counter and dropped it off here at the RHC leasing office. Please stop by to pick it up. We are open until 6:00 P.M. For after-hours service, call 0904 6802, and someone will assist you.

Toby, I'm at Cam's Furniture. The items you chose for our reception area look great! The salesperson told me the bill is going to be a little more than expected because there will be a charge for delivery and setup. The crew can come out to our office on Friday, so we'll definitely be able to have everything in place before our clients arrive on Monday.
**Toby Pesenti (1:59 P.M.)**
Great! The slightly higher cost shouldn't be a problem. We have enough in our budget.

Customer review posted by Linda Fei on 23 July at 5:32 P.M.
The staff at Cam's Furniture is extraordinarily helpful and professional. I was pleased that we could get eco-friendly pieces for our company's reception area. The furniture is beautiful—we've been receiving many compliments. Cam's delivery team spent extra time at our new office space to make sure that the furniture was arranged in exactly the right way. We look forward to shopping at Cam's again!`,
