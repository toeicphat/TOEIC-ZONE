**Driverless Buses in Swansea?**
SWANSEA (12 May)—A consortium of city government officials and local business leaders is considering the purchase of driverless buses for some city routes. Commissioned with exploring options to improve transportation in Swansea and surrounding areas, the group recently sent three members to Malaga, Spain, where driverless buses run an eight-kilometre loop several times a day.
Consortium member Gareth Elias was impressed by what he learned. Despite concerns about safety and traffic regulations, Mr. Elias could see driverless buses becoming a reality before long, but only in specific cases. "I believe they would be particularly useful during festivals and special events," he said. "I can't imagine them being on the roads every day."
Anisha Deepak, an engineer specialising in transportation innovation, served as a technical consultant on the trip. She was struck by the complexity of the buses' artificial intelligence system, which allows them to learn as they collect data on every trip.
"Artificial intelligence makes these buses very safe in real-world situations," she said. "Nevertheless, it's best to have a human operator on board at all times in case of emergencies."
A public community forum is scheduled for 2 June to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of driverless buses. Visit the Swansea Town Council's Web site at www.swanseatowncouncil.gov.uk to learn more.`,

Dear Team,
The past several years have been fast-paced. — [1] —. Five years ago, when I began selling my homemade pasta, I never expected to need a space larger than the kitchen in my own house. How things have changed! This week, the business won a contract to supply a regional food distributor here in Eastern Australia.
This achievement certainly would not have been possible without you. — [2] —. You have all worked hard to keep pace with such tremendous growth, and it was not always easy. To show my appreciation, I have decided that each of you will receive a bonus. — [3] —.
With our solid team and our streamlined production process, I am optimistic that we will see our product placed on even more supermarket shelves soon. — [4] —. The future looks bright.

Margo Basset [9:24 A.M.] Fantastic. Is she able to present on June 10 as we planned?
Alban Mithat [9:26 A.M.] She is, and she suggested that a panel discussion might be more engaging for her topic, renewable resources. She will moderate the discussion. I've e-mailed the three employees she suggested as panelists.
Margo Basset [9:27 A.M.] That sounds good. And the other sessions?
Stephan Ruess [9:28 A.M.] So, the topics for the other six sessions will be cryptocurrencies, commodities, investments, start-ups, real estate, and virtual interfaces. I hope to have speakers for those sessions lined up by the end of this week.

**Research Findings Presented**
GALWAY (1 July)—Eva Urban and her research team at the Ireland Agronomy Association presented their findings to the Galway Department of Transportation on Thursday. During their three-year study, the team was tasked with researching ways to improve the success of tree and shrub plantings along roadways. — [1] —.
"The ground next to newly paved roads is often compacted by heavy machinery associated with construction," Ms. Urban said. "As a result, the soil can't absorb water or nutrients well, which makes it difficult for new growth to establish itself. — [2] —. My team set up different experimental plots alongside highways and tried various combinations of planting, tilling, and amending soils to determine what worked."
The final results of the government-sponsored research project were compiled into a 50-page handbook. Although the handbook was written specifically for the Galway Department of Transportation, its recommendations can be applied by municipal agencies throughout the country. — [3] —.
"Each chapter explores one of the ten best practices identified by the team," said Ms. Urban. "These basic techniques are relevant regardless of where they are implemented. The only site-specific variable is plant selection, as that will depend upon the particular geographic region."
Another point conveyed by the study is that successful plant establishment requires an integrated approach. — [4] —. Improving roadside planting requires a thorough assessment of a site's existing conditions as well as a wide variety of management practices to address the specific issues involved.`,

GARDENDALE (December 20)—The Gardendale Neighborhood Association (GNA) honored Mayor Karla Fugate at its annual reception last Saturday. Mayor Fugate had been asked to give a short speech about the city's plans to build a new recreational center, after which she was presented with a special plaque to thank her for her role in the Westside Park project. According to GNA president Manuel Yuen, "Mayor Fugate was instrumental in making last year's fund-raising festival for the park a huge success." The festival raised thousands of dollars more than the GNA expected.
"It was a delightful surprise," said Mayor Fugate. "We set ourselves a difficult mission with the park project, but everybody in the GNA and the community at large came through admirably," the mayor continued.
The GNA reception was held in the Gardendale Botanical Garden, which offered a beautiful setting. The food was provided by Dawn Sky Catering, which included an individual chocolate cake for each guest decorated with the GNA logo.`,

Our retail stores have been accepting your CGS-P27 High-Speed Gaming Computers for repairs as arranged. As you may know, owners of your gaming system are reluctant to give up their devices for repair once they find that they will be without the system for two to three weeks. Today alone, three customers (PCI-70734, PCI-17503, and PCI-90022) declined to have their systems repaired.
The good news is that users of your gaming system are very loyal. However, to increase compliance with the recall and as a public relations gesture, you could provide us with several devices as part of a loaner program. Let me know how I can assist with this arrangement.

Thank you!

His extensive familiarity with a range of genres is apparent in his work. Titles range from the romantic *Send Me Some Roses* to the horror classic *That House*.
Rubio retired from filmmaking at age 65 after almost 40 years of directing, but he has kept busy. Most recently, he has been working as a guest lecturer at the nearby Weberton Film School.
Readers will be pleased to hear that our own Merrington Cinema will be showing Rubio's films throughout August. Whether you are a longtime fan or have never seen a Rubio film, you will surely enjoy this offering at Merrington Cinema.

I recently read a great article about director Pedro Rubio. It contained a lot of information about his work and life, including some surprising information about what he has been doing since he retired from filmmaking. The article also mentioned that Merrington Cinema would be showing his films. So I went to the cinema's Web site and saw the two-for-one deal. I thought this would be an excellent way to spend a Saturday, so I went! I saw two wonderful movies. One of the films I saw was new to me: it was about scientists on a mission in space. I loved it!
For a movie fan like me, Merrington Cinema's promotion was perfect. I understand there will be a similar promotion for Meredeth Bui's films in October. I'll be sure to take advantage of great offers like this again.

**Attachment:** Ji's Journey

Greetings!
My submission, "Ji's Journey," centers on a young dress designer, Toby Ji, who overcomes obstacles to realize her dreams in the fashion industry.
I was introduced to Undeniable last year by my writing instructor at the Artman Institute in Portland, Oregon, and have since become a subscriber. I particularly enjoy your Nonfiction Corner; one of my favorites was "Waygone Beach," which inspired me to write "Ji's Journey." I believe it would be an ideal fit for this section. Like "Waygone Beach," "Ji's Journey" is a true story of hope and perseverance.
Thank you for your consideration and for creating a forum for new writers like me.

Sincerely,
Len Sutherland
