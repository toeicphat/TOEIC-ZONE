Subject: Exertreks boots for winter activities

Hello Ms. Galloway,
I am sorry I missed your call this morning. The answers to your questions are given below.
We here at Exertreks have recently completed the development of our Winter Hikers. Like our other models, they are waterproof, but the Winter Hikers are most appropriate for use in extreme cold. The boots are lined with a proprietary material that is highly effective at retaining body heat. They are also durable, light, and comfortable. For orders of 50 pairs or more of the Winter Hikers, the wholesale price per pair is $65. The recommended retail price is $89. We can deliver your order in two weeks.
Presale reviews of the boots by experts in outdoor sports have been enthusiastic. You can expect the Winter Hikers to be a big hit with your customers this year. I look forward to hearing from you soon to answer any other questions and to help you with your first order.

Sincerely,
Samuel Bains`,

**Book Review: Leadership: Essays on Being a Great Leader**
As a businessperson, I am glad there is a publisher whose sole focus is on business. Skymill Publishing's latest book is a great one for leaders in all industries. Joan Cristophe has sought out some of the world's best minds to write essays for this book that will provide readers with some unique perspectives. In her own introduction, she argues that there is a greater need than ever before for more effective leaders in business.
Cristophe expertly arranges the essays in this collection so that the voices of each author complement one another. The essay by Xiaofeng Li is the perfect example of this. It is strategically sandwiched between Francisca Conde's essay on leadership in action and Ron Blake's essay on focusing on the details. Roderick Muller's essay is the sole disappointment. Surprisingly little new information or insight is offered on its pages, and the writing style is rather flat. Besides that, the collection is excellent, and readers with an interest in leadership in many different situations will find useful nuggets of wisdom and vision within.`,

UPTON (January 8)—Starting on May 25, hikers will be required to obtain a permit for each day they hike on certain trails in Upton parks. The designated trails include some of the most popular hiking spots in the area. The permits are free of charge and require only that hikers register online at www.uptonparks.org or at any Upton Parks Department office. Upon registering, hikers will receive a permit that they can print out or display on a mobile device. The move is part of an effort to reduce foot traffic on the most used trails, but some hikers are concerned. "I might not be able to get a permit for my favorite trails if none are left when I want to go," says Regina Faroni, an Upton parks hiker. "In addition, I often check the weather in the morning and then decide if it's a good day to hike," she says. Having to apply for a permit could prevent her from taking spontaneous hikes. "On the other hand, it would reduce the number of hikers on certain trails," Faroni admits.

Subject: Hiking permits
Date: January 22
To Whom It May Concern,
I read in the Upton Digest that hikers soon will be required to register for permits to hike on certain trails. As the organizer of the Upton Hiking Club, I would like more details on how this will affect our club. For example, is there a list of hiking trails that will require permits? I checked your Web site and could not find one.
Is it also the case that the number of permits issued will vary from trail to trail? About seventeen to twenty club members participate in our group hikes. I'm concerned that we may not get enough permits to hike together. Are there special considerations for large groups?
Finally, I am concerned that the permit requirement will not allow our club members to get together for a hike on the spur of the moment. We often will take an unplanned hike if we find that several members have a free day. I hope you are able to respond soon, as we are already planning our spring and summer hikes.
Regards, Arlo Gomes, Organizer, Upton Hiking Club

Hello, Mr. Gomes,
Thank you for your e-mail. I apologize that our Web site has not yet been updated with the information you were searching for and that the article in the Upton Digest was not clear. I have attached a proposed list of the twelve trails that will require permits and the number of permits that will be issued per day for each trail. The list will be finalized next month.
Permits can be reserved up to two weeks in advance, and the number of permits available for most trails is substantially higher than the number of Upton Hiking Club members who join your group hikes. Same-day permits can be obtained.
If you have not already done so, you can sign up on our Web site for our weekly newsletter. Doing so will ensure that you get advance notice of any updates to our policies.

Dear Ms. Osman,
We have a rental office just outside Indianapolis, about a ten-minute drive from Cumberland. If that is the drop-off location, you would have about 90 kilometers of driving from the starting point in Muncie. Based on this, we have updated your price estimate as follows.
Rental: 5-meter moving van for 1 day = $39.99
Rental: wheeled furniture cart = $6.99
Rental: furniture pads (set of 12) = $9.99
Distance: $1.05 per kilometer = $94.50 (90 kilometers estimated)
Vehicle damage insurance = $19.99
Total = $171.46
Please note that this total does not include taxes. The final price may vary based on the actual distance driven and will be calculated once the vehicle is returned to the drop-off location. Until that time, your credit card on file will be charged for the rental equipment only.
Sincerely,
